href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">《原子习惯》</a>或<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">《深度工作》</a>等超级畅销书属于同一类，但令她惊讶的是，它的受欢迎程度与它不同。</p><p>虽然得知你的作品被低估是一件令人深感荣幸的事情，但我认为有些人对适度流行的东西并不是超级流行的惊讶源于一种认知错觉。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么畅销书似乎很常见</h2><p>尝试想象你读过、看过或听说过的每一本书。那会是多少本书？</p><p>也许1000？</p><p>除非您是一位狂热的藏书家或从事出版工作，否则它可能不会超过 10,000。</p><p>现在尝试猜测实际写了多少本书。对于已出版的书籍，估计每年出版 50 万到 100 万本书。算上自行出版的图书，接近四百万册。美国国会图书馆拥有 3200 万册编目书籍，这比有史以来出版的每本书都要少。</p><p>这意味着您听说过的每本书（更不用说读过的书）只占现有图书总数的不到 0.00003%！</p><p>此外，您听说过的书籍并不是随机选择的样本。您听说过一本书的可能性与其在一般市场上的受欢迎程度密切相关。传统出版的书籍在其一生中通常会售出几千册。相比之下，超级畅销书的销量为数千万。</p><p>因此，普通读者对市场的了解如下： </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"

/></figure><p>少数（非常友善地）认为我被低估的人可能正在考虑十几本同一类型的流行书籍。由于上述偏见，这些例子不成比例地来自于非常成功的书籍。他们注意到我的书不如那些精英群体成功，并感到惊讶。</p><p>这些人错过了数十万本质量与我相似（或更好！）的书籍，他们从未听说过，因为它们不是畅销书！</p><p>这种分析适用于任何类型的创造性工作。我们关注拥有数百万订阅者的著名 YouTube 主播，却忽略了绝大多数订阅者不足 1000 的用户。我们听说过哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的精英科学家所做的研究，但没有听说过普通学者的工作。音乐、电影、新闻、体育和无数其他领域都遭受着同样的扭曲。</p><p>我非常感激能够让人们购买我的书，并邀请我参加播客。大多数人都没有得到这么多，即使是那些工作值得的人。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">质量怎么样？更好的书不是卖得更多吗？</h2><p>当然，畅销书并不是完全随机的。在詹姆斯·克利尔写<em>《原子习惯》</em>之前，我就一直羡慕他的写作能力，所以当他的书大受欢迎时，我并不感到惊讶。他是一位深思熟虑且富有魅力的作家。</p><p>虽然有些势利小人认为一本书的受欢迎是<em>低</em>质量的标志，但我认为这种看法反映了特定的品味，而不是描述大众市场的普遍特征。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15285' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/08/01/not-more-popular/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15285' title="例如，尽管存在刻板印象，但许多学术书籍都写得很好并且引人入胜。它们还需要更认真、更见多识广的读者来欣赏，这限制了潜在的受众。关于詹姆斯·帕特森的小说与高雅文学的受欢迎程度，也可以提出类似的论点。"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>然而，即使你试图证明流行度与潜在的写作质量完全相关，这两个尺度也有数量级的差异。</p><p>如果写作质量的范围是从 1 到 100，那么图书销量的范围是从零到数千万。<span id='easy-footnote-2-15285' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a

class="wp-block-heading">您应该期待什么程度的成功？</h2><p>从本质上讲，这表明我们在图书出版等领域取得成功的能力被相当悲观地降低了。如果我们极大地夸大了畅销书的比例，那么我们就隐含地高估了我们成功的几率。</p><p>我认为这有一定道理。</p><p>极限水平上的成功通常是许多竞争因素的重叠，只有其中一些因素是您可以控制的。如果你个人对成功或幸福的定义取决于是否属于少数精英，那么这种分析应该会让你认清这一目标的现实。</p><p>然而，即使您追求的是较为温和的成功，这种思考方式也可以帮助您做得更好。当成功比你想象的要难得多时，你需要<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/06/15/narrow-success/">密切关注什么是有效的</a>，努力掌握你的手艺的基本技能，并确保你致力于让它发挥作用。</p><p>在取得了一定的知名度后，我感谢所有喜欢我的作品的人。无论你认为我的工作被低估还是高估，我都非常感激有机会写一些我觉得有趣的事情。</p><p>文章<a

href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer">怀疑论者的经典修辞技巧</a>是指出大脑类比的历史。古希腊人将心灵视为一辆由理性和情感的马拉动的战车。勒内·笛卡尔将大脑视为一个液压系统。有人认为，每个时代都在摸索着大脑的最佳隐喻，我们的时代也不例外。正如加压流体控制大脑的想法在今天看来很愚蠢一样，未来的时代也会认为计算机的类比是古怪的。</p><p>但有充分的理由认为计算机的类比是不同的。</p><p>这并不是因为大脑实际上与笔记本电脑相似。相反，这是因为计算机科学发现计算是一个相对抽象的属性，并且许多完全不同的物理设备共享相同的约束和能力。</p><p>艾伦·图灵和阿朗佐·丘奇各自独立地发现，前者的<a

确实使事情变得更加复杂，但计算机的广泛设计仍然是这样，其中大多数计算是在整个设备内狭窄的物理空间中执行的，与存储、输入和输出分开。"><sup>4</sup></a></span>相比之下，大脑将计算分布在整个神经网络中。这种差异改变了可以使用的算法，这就是为什么人类思维与计算机代码有质的不同。</li><li><strong>身体具有与我们的环境相互作用的感觉输入和运动输出。</strong>人脑有数十亿个感觉细胞和数十亿个运动效应器，每个效应器都参与与环境的反馈循环。这与大多数人造计算机系统形成鲜明对比，这些计算机系统基本上与世界分离，除了输入和输出的小窗口之外。</li></ul><p>这些差异并非微不足道。但是，正如单个细菌和人类都是有机体一样，我认为值得强调的是，即使这些巨大的差异也不会改变大脑是一种计算机的基本事实。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">意义、情感和主观性又如何呢？</h2><p>在心理学和神经科学领域，<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604088">主要的争议</a>在于大脑是什么<em>样</em>的计算机，而不是它是否会计算。但我认为，来自这些领域之外的人对这一观点的更典型的反对是人文主义的。本质上，反对意见是：</p><ul><li><strong>计算机是有逻辑的；人类是有情感的。</strong>认知科学家会反驳说，情绪是一种计算。动机、注意力、恐惧、快乐和好奇心都是重要的功能属性。虽然算法的本质对于我们来说通过内省并不透明，但对于我们所有的认知过程来说，这基本上都是正确的。</li><li><strong>计算机没有感知能力；人类有意识。</strong>我<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661">同意丹尼尔·丹尼特（Daniel Dennett）的</a>观点，即<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">感受性</a>、 <a

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">“难题”</a>是一个混乱，而不是一个真正的难题。相比之下，虽然“简单”的问题仍未解决，但在解释<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-Thoughts/dp/0143126261">意识作为意识如何发挥作用</a>方面已经取得了相当大的进展。</li><li><strong>计算机是受规则控制的；人类的思维是整体性的。</strong>当串行计算机模型在人工智能中更为普遍时，休伯特·德雷福斯（Hubert Dreyfus）<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mind-Over-Machine-Hubert-Dreyfus/dp/0029080614">提出了反对计算机类比的著名论点</a>。然而，我想“什么样的电脑？”上面的框架很大程度上解决了这个问题。据推测，大脑大量的处理器和巨大的并行活动解释了直觉和整体思维的力量（和局限性）。</li><li><strong>我们是谁，以为​​我们可以“理解”灵魂？</strong>最后的反对意见只是诉诸神秘主义。我并不是主要反对这一点——如果你更愿意沉浸在生命的奥秘中而不是试图弄清楚问题，那是一个合理的选择。但显然，这与科学的目标背道而驰。</li></ul><p>我们对大脑如何运作的了解还不如对微生物学的了解。但是，正如<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism">生命论</a>被证明是错误的，生命实际上只是化学一样，我相信大脑实际上只是一台计算机，而正在进行的弄清楚它如何工作的科学项目是我们这个时代最令人兴奋的追求之一。</p><p><a rel="nofollow"

href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00663.x">同样</a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00562.x">的</a><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229940242_The_Effectiveness_of_Corrective_Feedback_in_SLA_A_Meta-Analysis">事情</a>？然而，这一证据被克拉申观点的支持者驳回，认为它证明了“学习”而不是“习得”。</li><li><strong>在纯输入学习环境中的人们<a href="https://scirp.org/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=476681">往往无法获得母语水平的语言流畅性</a>。</strong>这表明沉浸式学习的口语部分并不是多余的。</li><li><strong>尽管有数十年的全职接触，10-14 岁以上的成年人和青少年很少能完全达到母语水平。</strong>克拉申的理论将此归因于“情感过滤器”，它阻止纯粹的输入发挥其魔力。在我看来，这似乎难以置信，这可以解释六岁孩子几乎普遍成功地习得母语，但二十六岁孩子达到母语水平的发音和语法的几率却极其罕见。</li><li><strong>我们已经很清楚如何获得其他技能的隐性、流畅的知识。</strong>为什么同样的技能习得法则不适用于语言学习？即使存在特定于语言的机制，成人语言学习者似乎也可以从技能学习系统中受益。</li></ul><p>在学术界之外，克拉申的理论主要影响语言学习者，他们更喜欢阅读和聆听作为主要学习方法，而不是练习对话。</p><p>尽管<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">我更喜欢这种方法</a>，但我并不反对这种方法。鉴于说外语的机会可能有限，仅仅通过大量阅读和倾听，你可能就能走得很远。即便如此，我认为一些口语练习和正式指导对大多数学习者也有帮助。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我发现自己在焦虑/抑郁中挣扎，这让我更难实现我的主要目标。我应该怎么办？</p><p> <cite>（多名读者）</cite></p></blockquote><p>在所有这些情况下，我的第一个建议是，如果你正在与强迫性、消极的想法作斗争，如果可以的话，寻求治疗，特别是从事<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">认知行为治疗的</a>治疗师，因为它往往有最大的经验支持。</p><p> CBT 的效果往往与药物治疗相似（药物治疗似乎也很有效，因此很多人都从两者中受益）。 CBT 背后的基本理念是，我们可以进入相互强化的反复出现的思维、感觉和行动模式。</p><p>例如，患有社交焦虑症的人可能会对参加聚会有不愉快的感觉。这会引发人们对可能出现问题的生动想象（也许他们说错了话，让自己难堪）。焦虑感不断增强，直到他们取消邀请并呆在家里。这会带来一些暂时的缓解，但它会强化导致这种回避的思想和行为模式，并进一步加剧焦虑。</p><p>学会注意并禁用这些模式可能是减少它们对你的控制的重要一步。如果您无法获得治疗，我建议您阅读更多有关认知行为方法的内容，以便您了解工作的要点。</p><p>不过，我不是临床心理学家，所以我所说的不是医学建议，应该持保留态度。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您认为更有效的方法是什么：按任务管理您的一天还是按时间/日程表管理您的一天？</p><p> <cite>– 塔万</cite></p></blockquote><p>我曾经是 <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/04/08/how-to-finish-your-work-one-bite-at-a-time/">基于任务的方法的全心全意的倡导者：</a>列出每天的待办事项清单并努力完成它直到完成。</p><p>基于任务的方法的好处是它专注于完成工作。我发现当你有一堆可预测的任务需要完成，没有迫切需要为你的项目“做更多”，并且你可能有强烈的拖延冲动时，它很有效。当你的任务完成时结束会激励你完成所有事情，这样你就可以享受一天剩下的时间。</p><p>然而，当您正在处理的项目是开放式的，或者您正在尝试处理的任务很难提前预测时，这种方法可能会很困难。在这些情况下，我依靠固定时间表的方法来提高生产力。</p><p>我认为生产力系统的问题在于可能没有一个好的<em>通用</em>系统。相反，根据您的典型任务和目标，不同的方法效果更好或更差。作为一名大学生，我发现基于任务的系统运作良好。但我发现它在其他环境中会崩溃。同样，当你非常忙碌并且日历上有很多约会时，加州纽波特的<a href="https://www.timeblockplanner.com/">时间限制系统</a>效果很好，但如果你可以在没有它的情况下完成工作，那么它可能会让人觉得大材小用。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我很想了解更多关于遮挡眼睛如何影响运动技能学习的信息。蒙着眼睛或遮住一只眼睛进行练习的钢琴演奏者或网球演奏者。</p><p> <cite>– 奥拉</cite></p></blockquote><p>我不知道！我对运动技能文献的理解比教育心理学其他方面的理解要弱一些。</p><p>我知道，当我学习盲打时，我们在键盘顶部贴了一张纸，然后在下面打字，以防止我们看按键。这会鼓励您查看正在抄写的文档并直接记住关键位置。然而，许多其他技能似乎天生就与视觉/动觉反馈循环相关联，因此蒙住眼睛可能会导致性能因不明目的而恶化（例如，我不会蒙着眼睛从山上滑雪）。</p><p>我可以说，引入新颖的约束通常是将运动模式“转变”到新的平衡的好方法，而这种平衡很难仅通过有意识的努力来实现。有一项有趣的<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02701367.1999.10608029">研究</a>表明，当人们将注意力集中在运动目标而不是运动本身时，他们往往会更好地获得运动技能。这表明巧妙的限制可能有助于你改掉坏习惯。</p><p> _ _

href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">往往会在更有指导和结构化的课程中学得更好</a>。</strong>尽管非结构化、基于发现的方法很有吸引力，但与更直接的教学方法相比，它们往往表现不佳，除非你为它们做好准备。这并不意味着通过发现来学习是没有用的；而是意味着通过发现来学习是没有用的。简单地说，通过纯粹发现来学习的有效性并没有人们经常声称的证据基础。</li><li><strong>不相关技能之间的转移<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1249779.pdf">往往相当低</a>。</strong>学习大量随机事物可能会有一些好处，但考虑到在仔细控制的研究中几乎完全缺乏“远”转移，我想说举证责任在于声称转移很大的人，而不是相反。</li><li><strong>我不认为定义不明确的技能与定义明确的技能没有什么不同（我认为这就是你在将其与学习有“答案”的东西进行对比时所谈论的内容）。</strong>事实上，学习<em>的</em>很多意义在于明确定义一项技能。如果你什么都不知道，那么问题空间就会很大，并且你不确定大量的可能性。随着您了解更多，您会找到更好的方法来表示问题以及更好的方法来解决问题。</li></ol><p>我不认为成为一名多面手并学习很多东西有什么错。生活不仅仅是为了一个单一的目标而优化。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您有什么建议或策略可以更有效地从您阅读的书籍中学习吗？</p><p> <cite>-伊萨姆</cite></p></blockquote><p>我认为最重要的是多读书。阅读更多可以提高您的流利程度和背景知识，从而提高您的阅读率。人们确实低估了阅读对阅读速度的提高程度。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>学习风格怎么样？成为“视觉学习者”等是真实存在的吗？</p><p> <cite>-芯片</cite></p></blockquote><p>可能不会。</p><p>丹尼尔·威林汉姆（Daniel Willingham）<a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/learning-styles-faq.html">对反对“人有学习风格”这一观点的证据</a>进行了精彩的总结。要成为真正的“风格”，它应该意味着当信息以他们喜欢的方式呈现时，人们会学得更好。研究通常没有发现以这种方式定制信息可以增加学习收益。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我们一次可以学到多少东西？我们应该只选择一件事并达到一定水平，然后继续学习其他东西，还是可以同时学习多种东西？它是否会使我们的大脑超载，或者它是否有能力处理如此多的新信息？</p><p> <cite>-查里莎</cite></p></blockquote><p>您绝对可以在同一时间范围内学习多种内容。大多数中小学教育都是以此为基础的。我倾向于不鼓励同时进行多个自主学习项目，因为大多数人高估了自己可以完成的任务，最终得到了几个薄弱的项目，而不是一个有效的项目。但没有任何认知原因可以阻止它。</p><p>我认为同时学习高度相似的科目会产生问题。我从未尝试过同时学习两种新语言，尽管我建议连续练习多种语言以进行维护。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您是否有任何您确信可以提高注意力和生产力的补充剂？</p><p> <cite>-加雷斯</cite></p></blockquote><p>咖啡因？老实说，其实没什么。</p><p>我不相信促智药可以毫无副作用地发挥作用。为了让促智药有意义，你必须相信大脑<em>可以</em>比它实际工作得更好，但决定其性能的内部刻度盘只是设置得不理想。但为什么进化会形成这样的大脑呢？如果转动旋钮可以提高性能且没有任何负面影响，那么进化就已经做到了这一点。</p><p> My guess is that the true learning/focus enhancers will either have clear downside risks (eg, amphetamines), or they&#39;ll be targeted toward a particular deficiency/disability but not effective for the general population. I&#39;d be happy to be proved wrong here, but I&#39;d need to see a lot of good evidence first.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> I know some French as I lived in Quebec but left 30 years ago. What is the fastest way to learn it again in preparation for a trip to France in a few months?</p><p> <cite>-Harisch</cite></p></blockquote><p> Book some tutoring time with <a href="https://www.italki.com/dashboard">iTalki</a> and try chatting again.</p><p> For relearning, most of the issue is low fluency and self-confidence. It&#39;s less work since the knowledge is probably already in your head—it&#39;s just not as automatic. A few lessons should help you feel more fluent, which will also help with confidence which can be a big part of speaking a language.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> If you had to do the MIT Challenge all over again knowing what you know now about the scientific literature on learning, productivity, etc., what would you have done differently and why?</p><p> <cite>-Jeff</cite></p></blockquote><p> I initially dreamt up the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> as, “I wonder if you could learn all the CS courses MIT teaches?” and then further, “I wonder if I personally could do it in 12 months if I just focused on the exams.” As such, it was somewhat contrived since the aim was passing exams rather than acquiring the skill for a particular purpose. I&#39;ve said as much over the years, but the project would have looked entirely different if my end goal had been landing a programming job, launching a start-up, or becoming a researcher.</p><p> In terms of what I know now, there are a few things I can see as weaknesses that could have been remedied with a different approach. I passed a lot of exams by having a decent conceptual understanding. Still, my procedural knowledge of algebra/calculus was weak, which led to me struggling with the physics-based classes with a lot of math to wade through to compute the answer. If I did this project over, I&#39;d do massive drills to build up that fluency, maybe as a prerequisite project to starting the challenge itself.</p><p> Similarly, while I did the programming projects, the MIT CS degree was light on actual programming. It was a lot more theory and math. That&#39;s fine, but if I had intended to land a programming gig right after, I&#39;d have spent a couple months going deep on a particular language, ensuring I could fluently implement a lot of ideas I had covered.</p><p> Overall, I&#39;m not sure I would have changed much about how I studied. The timeframe constraints didn&#39;t leave much wiggle room to do things wildly differently. But if I had the broader goal of learning programming or computer science, I could imagine a lot of different approaches that might have better results for some purposes.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Why do I enjoy reading nonfiction since most is forgotten?

I often find my beliefs have been shifted in a direction even though I no longer recall the exact source of the argument. Some of what reading books does is shift your intuitions about situations in ways that don&#39;t always leave a trace back to their source.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> That&#39;s it for this week.

Yet there&#39;s still a ton I don&#39;t know!</p><p> Today, instead of offering answers, I&#39;d like to pose some questions I still have. I&#39;ll frame each question in terms of a specific topic, but each likely speaks to a broader issue that impacts other skills and subjects.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Unanswered Questions</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. When learning a broad subject, like history, how much time should be spent on retrieval practice versus new reading?</h3><p> I&#39;ve written before about the value of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1199327">retrieval practice over re-reading</a> . Give students an essay to read, and they learn more when they practice free recall of the essay&#39;s contents than if they re-read it again.</p><p> But the research here focuses on re-reading the same essay again. What about reading a different source? If you&#39;re studying a broad topic like history, do you learn more from retrieval activities or reading many other books and sources?</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Is it better to first watch a foreign language film with subtitles or without?</h3><p> Say you&#39;re watching a film in a language you are learning. You aren&#39;t to the point where you can understand what&#39;s happening from the first viewing. If you&#39;re going to watch more than once, should you watch with subtitles on the first or second viewing?</p><p> The argument for the first viewing would be that you&#39;d understand the plot and thus could better assimilate language on the second viewing. The argument for the second viewing is that you&#39;d attend to the words better and process them for meaning.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Should you start by struggling on challenging math problems or simply view the instructions?</h3><p> This isn&#39;t just my question—it&#39;s a hotly debated area of educational research. Manu Kapur&#39;s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543211019105">productive failure</a> experiments argue in favor of presenting difficult-to-solve problems first. In contrast, others&#39; experiments on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">cognitive load theory</a> argue in favor of starting with explicit instructions.</p><p> Both theories support problem-solving as you gain expertise, as it provides needed practice. But the question is whether beginners, who are unlikely to know the correct solution beforehand, benefit more from problem-first or examples-first approaches.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. How many words in a new language should you study via flashcards?</h3><p> I&#39;m a big fan of learning vocabulary with flashcards. At my peak, I had around 16,000 cards for Mandarin and several thousand for Korean and Macedonian.</p><p> Memorizing the central meaning of a word is much faster to do via flashcards than incidental exposure. Yet a flashcard only teaches you part of what you need to know about a word. You can&#39;t get a feel for when the word is likely to show up or what words it goes with, and you need practice to recognize and use it in context.</p><p> My hypothesis is that flashcards are useful—but only to a point. Common words are good to learn, as are some uncommon ones. But how far should you go? The most common 100, 1000, or 9000 words? Should you focus on single, core meanings or quiz yourself on variations (eg, one card for “divide” versus cards for “divide,” “division,” “divisive,” etc.)</p><p> Learning a new word incidentally is almost always slower than learning it deliberately. Still, it has the added advantage of the complete context, plus additional practice on the other words in the context. At some point, learning words “in context” will probably become more efficient than rote memorization. The question is where this trade-off point occurs.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. If you&#39;re learning to ski or snowboard, do you learn faster if you stick to the easy slopes and perfect your technique or take on the steepest slope you can comfortably manage?</h3><p> For cognitive skills, there&#39;s support for getting the method “right” from the beginning. If you learn a mathematics algorithm incorrectly, there are few opportunities to self-correct that knowledge later.</p><p> However, there seem to be different schools of thought for physical skills. One school would argue for perfecting the “correct” technique before moving on. This is the view that sloppy technique is hard to fix later, so it should be mastered before taking on harder challenges.</p><p> Another school would argue that once you&#39;ve intellectually understood the technique, you benefit more from practicing in difficult/varied situations rather than trying to perfect it in an easier setting. Yet those complex settings likely to introduce errors and thus lead to long-term headaches.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. How useful is learning academic computer science for a successful programmer?</h3><p> This question has been on my mind since my <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> . On the one hand, knowledge of number theory, analysis of algorithms and logic play a role in programming practice. On the other hand, who has ever sat down to prove the complexity class for a problem before they begin working on it?</p><p> This question of the relationship between academic theory and practical skills shows up in many fields. Opinions on academic relevance range from, “Of course, you need to learn that!” to, “Nobody has ever used this on the job.”</p><p> Possible answers include:</p><ul><li> It helps, but mostly with advanced work, not entry-level work.</li><li> It helps by making the practical skills “make sense,” assisting with future learning.</li><li> It doesn&#39;t help much with programming, but it helps you land a job.</li><li> It&#39;s less efficient than simply learning programming directly.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Do you gain greater chess proficiency by playing slower or faster games?</h3><p> Say you want to increase your chess score rapidly. Should you focus on longer games, where there is more time to think for each move, or faster games, which have less time to think, but you end up seeing more board positions for each hour spent playing.</p><p> I suspect both ends have an extreme where learning benefits break down. Spending a year per game, or spending less than a second per move, is probably not efficient. But where does the optimal point sit in between?</p><p> While this question matters for chess, of course, definitively answering it would say a lot about other skills which can be done at varying “speeds” and have trade-offs between depth of analysis and quantity of exposure.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. If you want to paint in a “loose” style, should you first learn to paint with “tight” control?</h3><p> Similar to playing chess fast and slow is the question of cultivating an artistic style. Suppose you want to paint in a “loose” or “painterly” fashion. Would it make sense to learn with greater control first and then loosen up as you gain experience, or should you paint relatively loose from the start?</p><p> The argument for starting with greater control is that much of what we like in skillful, loose painting styles is that the artist can communicate much with an economy of movement and brushstrokes. Beginners can&#39;t do that, so they&#39;re better off learning the fundamentals and loosening up as they get better.</p><p> An analogy for this might be math: An experienced mathematician can simply shout out the answer to a complex question, whereas a beginner would need to do the calculations ploddingly by hand to get that same answer. We would never expect just shouting out an answer to be a way for a beginner to gain the expert&#39;s knowledge.</p><p> The argument for starting looser is that the skill of controlled painting is different from looser works. So stylistically, an early focus on control may make it harder to develop a successful, loose style later.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What are Some of Your Unanswered Questions?</h2><p> Those were some of my unanswered questions—what about yours?

Intensive projects are hard to schedule, challenging to execute and may lack sufficient spacing for long-term retention.</p><p> The best approach isn&#39;t to steadfastly stick to a particular format for working on a goal but to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. So, today I&#39;d like to explore what sorts of learning minimal habits are actually useful for.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What are Minimal Habits Good For?</h2><p> The minimal-habit approach to learning, provided you can sustain it over long periods, has two key advantages: spacing and convenience.</p><p> Spacing refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> , a well-studied phenomenon. We retain information better when there are longer intervals between when we are exposed to it than when the same amount of exposure happens over a shorter amount of time. Thus, seeing a vocabulary item ten times over ten days will result in more durable memory than seeing it ten times in one hour. By drawing out learning over very long timeframes, minimal habits can potentially take advantage of the spacing effect and, thus, result in more durable memories than crammed schedules.</p><p> The second advantage of minimal habits is that they&#39;re convenient. As I mentioned in the previous essay, it feels mean to discourage people from cultivating minimal habits since the alternative is often to do nothing. Life is busy, learning is hard, and sometimes you only have ten minutes to spare.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15217' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15217' title="This argument is somewhat refuted when people have &lt;em>;several&lt;/em>; minimal habits to learn different things, which suggests that they could work on one thing at a time but have difficulty deciding which to focus on."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Given these two advantages, I think it&#39;s worth examining what types of learning aims might be appropriate for a simple, minimal habit spread over a very long time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> When Should Minimal Habits Work?</h2><p> Based on my mental model of minimal habits, I would expect them to work when the practice activity has low cognitive load and can be fit into a small space of time.</p><p> The basic idea behind <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">cognitive load theory</a> is that information must make its way through a narrow bottleneck of conscious experience for learning to occur. Complex subjects and skills, those with many pieces of information that must all be put together before you can understand them, create a high cognitive load. This is one reason why learning mathematics and physics is difficult.</p><p> However, cognitive load isn&#39;t constant for a subject! As you learn, your brain uses mechanisms, such as chunking or retrieval cues, to minimize the burden on your working memory. For example, when you first learn to read, it has a very high cognitive load because you must work to recognize each letter. But eventually, the cognitive load of reading becomes low as you automatically recognize words and sentences.</p><p> New learning varies in its demands on working memory. Some skills and concepts are intrinsically higher in cognitive load since they have many new, interacting parts. In contrast, other ideas are essentially isolated from each other and can be learned one at a time.</p><p> Consider learning to calculate quantum-mechanical orbitals in chemistry versus memorizing masses on the periodic table. The former has a lot of pieces of information that all need to be used simultaneously to perform the calculation. In contrast, the memorization task involves (mostly) unrelated facts.</p><p> In light of this, flashcards might help you memorize the periodic masses, but they wouldn&#39;t work well for learning to solve the differential equations to find electron orbitals. The kinds of problems in the calculation task require that you “load” a lot of information into short-term memory so that, for all but the most seasoned chemists, the effective practice activity would look more like a problem set that you must focus on for some time.</p><p> <strong>Minimal habits are probably better for maintaining knowledge and fluency than moving to a new skill frontier.</strong> Continued, repetitive practice spaced over time is ideal for boosting fluency, but it&#39;s less effective for making deliberate adjustments in the presence of corrective feedback.</p><p> Thus, a low-key daily writing habit will probably make writing <em>easier</em> , but it may not help you reach a substantially higher level of proficiency. The latter would presumably require deliberate practice constraints that force you to use styles or structures that don&#39;t come automatically and require a certain amount of focus and effort (and likely some outside feedback). This is difficult, or impossible, to sustain as a minimal habit.</p><p> The other constraint on minimal habits is that the practice activity needs to fit—and be effective—in a sliver of time each day. Thus downhill skiing, for instance, probably can&#39;t be made into a minimal habit by most people since it requires a lengthy trip up a snowy mountain before you can get some runs in. Many skills are difficult to practice minimally because no relevant kind of practice will fit into that timeframe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Examples of Where Minimal Habits Might Work</h2><p> I&#39;ve used minimal habits in the past—both effectively and ineffectively. The theory articulated above spells out where I think they work (and where they fail). In particular, I think minimal habits might work well for:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad subject knowledge.</strong> Daily blog reading, educational YouTube videos or skimming a relevant subreddit will not produce expertise. Still, it can give you good <em>coverage</em> of the main ideas, even if you&#39;d need serious practice to become proficient in using them.</li><li> <strong>Flashcards and memorizing isolated facts.</strong> Things that can be made into atomic, independent pieces of quickly-testable knowledge are also good candidates. I&#39;ve successfully used fragments of time to learn a lot of vocabulary, and it can be good for maintaining knowledge, too.</li><li> <strong>Fluency and maintaining established skills.</strong> Keeping effort minimal can help build fluency with material, a non-trivial part of eventual mastery.</li></ul><p> In contrast, I expect minimal habits to be poorly suited to situations requiring deliberate practice; learning new, complex skills; or when effective practice is not possible within the time/effort constraints demanded by the minimal habit.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that the patient/impatient distinction is often dwarfed by the larger consideration of time actually spent learning. According to <a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">some reasonable estimates</a> , mastery of a language can take 500-2000 hours of classroom time. If you were to follow the five-minutes-per-day approach with a “hard” language, like Mandarin, that would mean almost seventy years before you hit that threshold! If you don&#39;t actually practice enough, even the most efficient learning strategy won&#39;t get you there.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">When are Minimal Habits Useful for Learning?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Problem with Being Too Patient</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15198 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Is patience a vice or a virtue in learning?

After all, getting good at things takes a long time, and only those who are in it for the long haul can expect to reach the pinnacle of their craft.</p><p> Given that common association, I found it interesting to hear the opposite perspective from <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pro-Lessons-Father-Claude-Harmon/dp/0307338045">Butch Harmon</a> , Tiger Wood&#39;s coach during the best years of his golfing career:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Those golfers who insist on being patient and letting the game come to them rarely play up to their potential. They play well, maybe win a time or two, but they never reach the great heights their talents dictate. The players who want to learn, get better, and win right now—this second, no waiting—are the ones who exceed their natural abilities and become the game&#39;s great overachievers.</p></blockquote><p> Harmon later goes on to explain why Tiger was one of the least-patient people he had ever met:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> When Tiger wants to do something with his golf swing, he wants it done now. No phasing it in and no long-term planning. Once he decides to make a change, he makes it fully and immediately. Then he works himself ragged until he perfects it, exhibiting little or no patience along the way.</p></blockquote><p> In Harmon&#39;s view, patience was often wishful thinking: the hope of future proficiency preventing you from really working today at what you want to improve.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Five-Minutes-Per-Day Problem and Learning Hard Things</h2><p> Harmon&#39;s quote made me think about a phenomenon I&#39;ve often seen in self-improvement circles. It is the idea that what matters most for learning is doing a tiny bit of something, every day, over a long period of time.</p><p> This approach is exemplified by the language learner who plans to become fluent in a language by playing on Duolingo for five minutes a day, the would-be novelist who commits to writing one page a week, or the aspiring photographer taking one picture a day.</p><p> It feels mean to be discouraging of this approach. After all, most people do nothing toward their aspirations, so doing something, even a little bit, is better than nothing.不是吗？</p><p> However, I can&#39;t help but feel that this approach is akin to the wishful thinking exemplified by Harmon&#39;s “patient” golfers—people who used the slowness of eventual mastery to dodge the demanding work of learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Logic of Minimal Habits</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s probably helpful to revisit why this approach is so popular in self-improvement circles. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">Atomic Habits</a> , a fantastic best-seller written by my friend James Clear, is one of the most obvious proponents of the “start small” approach to self-improvement.</p><p> The logic of habit-building is compelling:</p><ol><li> Starting is hard.</li><li> Small habits are easier to commit to.</li><li> Once you start, it&#39;s easier to ramp up and do more.</li></ol><p> Thus, the logic goes, the person who does ten minutes a day on Duolingo is building momentum for a larger habit of practicing speaking with people. By lowering the bar for entry, they begin the self-improvement process, while having high expectations may have made it too hard to get started.</p><p> Phrased this way, the logic of minimal habits is undeniable. I think it&#39;s an important behavioral technique for getting started with anything, especially when the thing you&#39;re trying to do feels unpleasant. I have used this approach to get back into exercising when I haven&#39;t felt like doing so. I would never criticize someone for starting with smaller, enjoyable habits to break into something they find frustrating or unpleasant but want the outcomes of.</p><p> My concern is with #3. Theoretically, it&#39;s easy to ramp up and do more once you&#39;ve started. But in practice, the minimal habit often becomes the destination, not a warm-up for something bigger. And I&#39;m skeptical that such “patient” approaches to practice will reliably result in substantial improvements.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Effective is the “Patient” Approach to Mastery?</h2><p> I&#39;m not aware of any research that specifically pits “five-minutes-per-day” habits against more typical curricula for skills people want to master. The costs and difficulties of longitudinal studies mean that empirical research is generally somewhat scant over extended time frames.</p><p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> in psychology would seem to support the slower, patient approach. Memories tend to be more durable when there are longer intervals between reviewing information than when the same review is massed together (as when cramming for a test). However, real-world studies of language learning <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/07/learning-fast-or-slow/">tend to find the opposite</a> , finding that more intensive curricula have the edge over more stretched-out approaches.</p><p> My guess is that which approach is more effective, whether five minutes daily or intensive bursts, depends on the exact nature of the skill being learned, the practice activities used, and the knowledge the learner begins with. I suspect that complex skills favor a more intensive approach, whereas broad, knowledge-based subjects tend to favor a more patient approach.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15198' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15198' title="A full discussion of exactly what sorts of skills (or sub-skills) benefit from different learning schedules is outside the scope of this essay. Learning vocabulary via flashcards, for instance, seems well-suited to an extended schedule, but the procedural fluency needed for conversations probably benefits from a more intensive one. Similarly, learning about history by watching recorded lectures can probably be done leisurely, but developing the analytical skills of a historian will require a more focused approach. My point here is that my argument that certain categories of “long-term habits” are ineffective for their purpose shouldn’t be misconstrued as the opposite point that an intensive schedule is always better for acquiring all types of skills."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> However this kind of analysis is probably beside the point because, in general, the sorts of things people do for learning when they opt for a five-minute daily habit are categorically different from those they would do in a typical classroom setting or as part of a focused learning project.</p><p> Here, “patient” approaches suffer from several serious drawbacks:</p><ul><li> <strong>Limited time constrains the types of practice you can do.</strong> In five minutes a day, you can complete an exercise on Duolingo, but meaningful conversation practice needs more time. Watching a video of someone painting can be done in five minutes, but replicating that painting yourself takes more time.</li><li> <strong>A focus on “sustainability” avoids necessary effort</strong> . When you pick activities designed to be sustainable over months or years, there&#39;s a bias against picking anything too effortful or time-consuming. This eliminates a lot of the intense, deliberate practice needed to achieve mastery.</li><li> <strong>Long timeframes make it harder to tell if you&#39;re making progress</strong> . Improvement is evident when you&#39;re learning a lot over a few months. If you&#39;re not making progress, you change your approach. When improvement is something expected to occur years in the future, how do you know if you&#39;re actually getting better at the underlying skill?</li></ul><p> For these reasons, I&#39;m skeptical of many of the proposed plans I&#39;ve heard from readers to achieve mastery via simple, long-term habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Mastery is Slow—and Impatient</h2><p> In his research on <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">deliberate practice</a> , Anders Ericsson articulated the view of mastery that most closely corresponds with my own. He argued that mastery is a slow process, and also an impatient one:</p><ul><li> <strong>Mastery is slow because it takes a long time</strong> . No, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> is not an exception to this. I do think it&#39;s possible to learn more efficiently, and that effectively-designed projects can help people accomplish more than they think possible. But genuine mastery (not just relatively quick intermediacy) requires a long time, and nothing I&#39;ve worked on is an exception to that rule.</li><li> <strong>Mastery is impatient because the work required is deliberate, effortful and striving</strong> . Deliberate practice was Ericsson&#39;s term to describe the kind of learning efforts put in by elite performers in chess, music and athletics. It clearly describes Tiger Woods, Harmon&#39;s most famous student.</li></ul><p> I believe this is true even if you don&#39;t aspire to world-class greatness. Even getting “good enough” requires a level of commitment that&#39;s difficult to reach with minimal habits alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">The Problem with Being Too Patient</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:54:47 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15181 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Flashcards should be the base for learning any memory-intensive subject, mnemonics layered on top (if that).</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Suppose you have to memorize a lot of material—vocabulary words in a new language, terminology for an anatomy class, legal precedents, or dates of historical events.

Everyone has done them before. They&#39;re dry and elementary. You put a question on one side, the answer on the other and you drill (and drill and drill) until you can do them without thinking. No fantastical imagery or secret method. Just repetition.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Flashcards are Underrated</h2><p> While mnemonics might seem like the obvious choice for learning a ton of new information, research rigorously comparing the efficacy of various studying strategies paints a somewhat different picture.</p><p> In their excellent review of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/Z10jaVH/60XQM/full">ten popular studying techniques</a> , Dunlosky and colleagues summarized the research on both the keyword mnemonic method and practice testing (which includes flashcards). In this review, practice testing got the highest possible rating for usefulness, while the keyword mnemonic got a low grade.</p><p> The keyword method does work—that is, students who use it tend to remember the words they were memorizing better than those who didn&#39;t. But it had a number of limitations:</p><ul><li> <strong>It takes time to learn and teach mnemonic methods.</strong> Unlike flashcards, mnemonics is itself a skill that requires considerable practice to get good at. While this may benefit elite mnemonists, it may not be worth the additional investment for those who simply want to learn Spanish, law or anatomy.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics often take a good deal of time, especially for beginners.</strong> It may take a few minutes to create a good link with the keyword method, in which time you could have done several repetitions with flashcards. One study, which equalized the time-on-task between mnemonics and more rote memorization, found that simply increasing repetition provided an advantage over using the mnemonic.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics greatly assist with recall over relatively short intervals, but their benefits might not endure.</strong> This makes mnemonics useful in memory competitions—events that require memorization of highly arbitrary information with near-immediate recall. In contrast, much of what we&#39;re trying to memorize needs to stay in our heads for much longer.</li></ul><p> Flashcards, in contrast, are simple and quick. While all memory fades eventually, the repetitive overlearning caused by flashcards is one of the more durable ways to create long-term learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Direct Retrieval is the End Goal of Learning</h2><p> Empirically, mnemonics are a bit of a mixed bag. Flashcards seem to have the advantage, at least in carefully controlled studies of longer-term recollection in students who aren&#39;t already trained in mnemonic techniques.</p><p> Cognitive theory also lends support to this perspective. A major feature of skill acquisition is that the methods used to achieve a result are not constant. For <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emerging-Minds-Process-Childrens-Thinking-ebook/dp/B000QTD49E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">instance</a> , children learning simple addition start by counting both numbers on their hands, then count from the bigger number and finally retrieve the answer directly.</p><p> As expertise develops, more elaborate methods tend to be replaced by direct retrieval of the answer. This is one reason that expertise can be relatively effortless—instead of going through an elaborate process to get to an answer, you just remember it.</p><p> Mnemonics, in this light, can be seen a little bit like the finger-counting. The vivid imagery acts as a bridge between two concepts that would otherwise be difficult to associate. You can quickly learn the mnemonic and it enabling you to cross over from one idea to the other. However, if you practice enough, the two ideas get directly associated—with no intervening imagery.</p><p> For situations where fluency is particularly important, such as recalling vocabulary words while speaking, the direct retrieval option is perhaps necessary for a majority of words in order to not get bogged down while speaking too much. This suggests that even if you initially learn a word via mnemonics, direct retrieval will eventually take over as it becomes the faster option.</p><p> This suggests that mnemonics are, at best, a temporary measure. They may make learning an association easier, in the short-to-medium term, for words that haven&#39;t been sufficiently overlearned to form a direct association. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15190" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Not Both?</h2><p> Of course, flashcards and mnemonics are not mutually exclusive. You can use the keyword mnemonic when you first encounter a flashcard and then study it repeatedly. In this way, the temporary bridge offered by the mnemonic may be beneficial to learning.</p><p> This is the approach I&#39;ve used when I&#39;ve had to memorize a lot of material. I start with the keyword mnemonic, when that is relatively easy to do, and follow with a lot of spaced retrieval practice to make the association automatic and robust.</p><p> However, I think it&#39;s worth examining the relative efficacy of the two techniques for a few reasons:</p><ul><li> <strong>Many people get overly excited about mnemonics and use them instead of flashcards.</strong> I think this is often ill-advised for the reasons I&#39;ve articulated above.</li><li> <strong>Sometimes the material isn&#39;t mnemonics-friendly.</strong> I found the keyword mnemonic great for learning vocabulary in European languages—but far less helpful for Asian languages. The “sounds like” method doesn&#39;t easily discriminate between words in Chinese (which all sound like each other much more than they sound like words in English) so the first leg in the bridge is weak. However flashcards continued to work and were my primary tool for learning Chinese and Korean vocabulary.</li><li> <strong>For those not trained in mnemonics, it&#39;s worth asking how much time should be invested in acquiring the skills needed.</strong> While mnemonics have some valid use cases, they are often slow and cumbersome without lots of practice, meaning they are best reserved for situations where they&#39;re likely to be used across many memory-intensive subjects.</li></ul><p> In short, if you are proficient with mnemonics, by all means, use them to supplement your flashcards. If you&#39;re not, or your subject makes using them difficult, or you simply aren&#39;t sure which one to prioritize, stick with the flashcards.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> When is Learning Worth the Effort?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 30 May 2023 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15172 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Do we underinvest in learning? An exploration of the logic of learn-or-delegate decisions.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> One of the few lessons I recall from business school is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/make-or-buy-decision.asp">make-or-buy decision</a> . Big companies often face a choice: should they make something in-house, or outsource it to a supplier?</p><p> The decision depends on many factors, but a big part is cost: will it be cheaper or more reliable if you invest in in-house production? Or does it make more sense to pay someone else to do it?</p><p> Decisions about whether or not to learn something are often similar. For almost any conceivable skill you can:</p><ol><li> Learn to do it yourself.</li><li> Hire someone else to do it.</li><li> Avoid doing it entirely.</li></ol><p> Consider programming. You could learn to write code, hire a programmer to do it for you, or choose work and projects that don&#39;t require you to create software.</p><p> Or language learning. You could learn to speak Mandarin, hire a translator, or avoid doing business with monolingual Mandarin speakers.</p><p> The same choice applies to countless other skills, from understanding the tax code to applying medical advice, repairing drywall or planting a garden. You can learn, outsource or avoid.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Learning Rarely Makes Sense Short-Term</h2><p> One common feature of this problem is that the costs of learning rarely make sense if you&#39;re only thinking about immediate benefits. Even if you&#39;re the smartest person on earth, hiring a Mandarin translator, Java programmer or car mechanic to deal with your problem still takes less time and energy than learning to solve it yourself from scratch.</p><p> Yet, if you already know how to solve a problem, doing it yourself is often (but not always) the most effective option. Hiring people takes time, increases the possibility they won&#39;t understand or be able to deliver what you want and can be more expensive.</p><p> Viewed this way, the optimal point for many learn-or-delegate decisions depends on your prior expertise: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15173" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> This analysis suggests you should do what you&#39;re good at, and delegate what you&#39;re not.</p><p> The major wrinkle in this approach is that <em>your level of expertise isn&#39;t constant</em> . It varies depending on the amount of practice you&#39;ve had on the problem. One of the most famous empirical results is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law_of_practice">power law of practice</a> , suggesting that many aspects of proficiency follow a roughly power-law relationship with the amount of practice.</p><p> The answer to the learn-or-delegate decision doesn&#39;t depend only on your current level of expertise, but also on how often you expect to perform the skill. If you&#39;re currently below the competency threshold where doing it yourself makes sense but will probably use the skill a lot, the total lifetime cost of learning may end up being less than delegating: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15174" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> While I&#39;m using an economic lens here, the reasoning still applies outside your job. How much I enjoy painting as a hobby depends on how good I feel I am at it. Thus there&#39;s often an implicit learn-or-ignore decision with recreational activities that follows the same trade-off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Do We Underinvest in Learning?</h2><p> To summarize, many decisions about learning have the following features:</p><ul><li> Doing it yourself doesn&#39;t initially pass a cost-benefit test.</li><li> The more you practice, the lower the cost becomes.</li><li> Thus whether it&#39;s “worth it” to learn something depends on a far-sighted calculation of how much you&#39;ll need to use the skill.</li></ul><p> Unfortunately our intrinsic motivational system is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/12/14/procrastinate-expert/">remarkably short-term in its focus</a> . Immediate costs or payoffs influence our decision far more than long-term ones. Experiments show people often pay steep discount rates for delayed rewards, in <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-02">ways that are inconsistent</a> with any rational agent (even an extremely impulsive one).</p><p> This suggests we may be underinvesting in learning. We&#39;re disinclined to practice skills that fail an initial cost-benefit analysis—even if our investment of practice would be profitable over the course of our lifetime.</p><p> This insight helped Vat and me while learning other languages. The costs of practicing a language are relatively high when you&#39;re not consistently using it. In the short term, forcing yourself to interact in a new language is also costly. But, if you practice enough, speaking the language of the country you&#39;re visiting becomes easier than sticking entirely within an English bubble. Adults are resourceful and frequently find ways to avoid using an unfamiliar language; the consequence is that few get anything close to the levels of exposure that young children can&#39;t help but get when learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Matthew Effects in Learning</h2><p> Another consequence of this basic model is that we should expect Matthew Effects in learning.</p><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">The Matthew Effect</a> was first coined by sociologists Robert Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in their study of elite scientists. Eminent scientists often get more credit than unknown researchers for similar work, meaning that, over time, eminence tends to compound while less famous academics linger in obscurity.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15172' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15172' title="The name of the effect comes from the parable of the talents in the Gospel of Matthew, &amp;#8220;For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.&amp;#8221;"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Later, psychologist Keith Stanovich applied <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">the same insight to reading</a> . Those with a slight advantage in early reading ability had a slightly reduced cost of reading new material. This lead to them practicing more, further reducing the costs of reading. Given the connection between reading and other forms of learning, he even hypothesized that early reading ability might bootstrap intelligence by making it easier to acquire new skills and knowledge.</p><p> Research bears out Stanovich&#39;s hypothesis. In <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12272">a study looking at identical twins</a> who varied in early reading ability, the slightly more proficient twin later showed gains in intelligence compared with their genetically-identical sibling. Skills beget skills; knowledge begets knowledge.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Specialization and Focusing on Strengths</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s helpful to clarify. I&#39;m not suggesting that since learned skills get easier with practice, we should do everything for ourselves and never delegate.</p><p> This is false, even by the basic logic I&#39;ve spelled out above. Some tasks simply aren&#39;t encountered frequently enough to cross the cost/benefit threshold. I may never have an opportunity to speak Mongolian, so if I ever meet a monolingual Mongolian speaker, I&#39;d be happy to lean on Google Translate.</p><p> Additionally, we can&#39;t consider skills in isolation. Spending time learning one thing is an implicit decision not to learn something else. I could learn French, but that time is taken away from learning Mandarin. I could learn Javascript, but that time can&#39;t also be spent learning Python.</p><p> Ultimately, specialization, not self-sufficiency, is the road to abundance in the world we live in today. We delegate the vast majority of skills in our lives, not because learning them all is impossible, but because getting really good at one thing makes sense when it&#39;s relatively easy to delegate everything else.</p><p> Despite spending years learning programming, I do virtually none of it for my own business. Given that my writing is central to my business, and I don&#39;t have enough time to do all the writing I&#39;d like, hiring other people to do the programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">makes more sense</a> . Those people, in turn, tend to be much further along the expertise curve than I am because they&#39;ve made a similar decision to specialize.</p><p> That being said, there are many instances where skills can&#39;t easily be delegated. I might be able to hire out behind-the-scenes programming for my website, but it doesn&#39;t save effort or cost to hire someone to read the research used to write the articles. If I don&#39;t understand the research, I can&#39;t weave it into the text I&#39;m producing.</p><p> In other cases, delegation is an imperfect or inconvenient substitute for being able to do something yourself. Relying on a translator is not equivalent to being able to speak the language yourself when you move to another country. Being able to read a text isn&#39;t made redundant if someone narrates it to you aloud. Thus being able to speak the language of the country you live in and being able to read are skills that are almost certainly worth mastering.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Thinking about Learning in the Long-Term</h2><p> I find it useful to keep in mind a few things when I face resistance to learning something new:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. How much can I expect this skill to get easier with more practice?</h3><p> One way to estimate this is to look at people with varying degrees of experience. How much effort did it take them to do what you struggle with? The learning curve is quite steep for some skills—you get good relatively quickly. For others, the curve is flat for a long time—you may need to practice for years before you feel it&#39;s worth the effort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. How much would I use the skill if I was better at it?</h3><p> Supposing you could reach the relatively flat part of the practice curve, how much would you use it?</p><p> If you live in a country that speaks a language you don&#39;t know, learning that language would definitely pass the cost-benefit test. Learning a major world language you might use in work or educational contexts probably also does. A niche language that isn&#39;t spoken much … maybe not? In this case, it may only be worth learning if you have a strong intrinsic motivation to learn it.</p><p> If a skill is central to your career, it may easily be worth the cost, even if it is initially difficult for you to learn. In contrast, a career skill that doesn&#39;t fit well with your existing skills may go unused even if you&#39;re nearly an expert—it&#39;s simply cheaper to outsource.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. How much would I enjoy the skill, conditional on being better at it?</h3><p> Economic rewards aren&#39;t the only motivation. If you&#39;re good at something, you tend to enjoy it more and draw personal satisfaction. But that&#39;s more true of some skills than others. You might be particularly proud of being able to paint a realistic landscape but not feel too special about being able to file your taxes quickly.</p><p> Deciding when it makes sense to learn isn&#39;t trivial, but given that our intuitions often give us a misleadingly short-term picture of what&#39;s possible, it can be helpful to think more deeply about it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15151 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Need to learn something difficult?

Of those that do, they often make mistakes that render the plan highly unrealistic—a recipe for future guilt, not future learning.</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to outline how to make a studying plan—and how you can stick to it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Make a Studying Plan?</h2><p> Learning is effortful. Although that effort can be enjoyable, our impulses about what to do in the moment often don&#39;t coincide with what would maximize learning. Indeed, the research shows that students frequently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">choose activities</a> that feel fun but don&#39;t deliver results.</p><p> A good analogy is exercise. While playing a sport or going for a jog can be fun, our brains are designed to avoid unnecessary physical exertion. That&#39;s why you rarely see anyone over the age of ten running down the street unless they&#39;re late for an appointment.</p><p> If you want to develop fitness without injuring yourself, it helps to have a workout plan you can and will stick to, rather than just going to the gym whenever you feel like and working on whatever equipment you stumble into.</p><p> The logic is the same for studying. Having a plan maximizes the chance of investing effort where it counts to create learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step One: Review Your Materials </h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already chosen some class, book, tutorials or other curriculum to guide you. (If you haven&#39;t, the first step is to do your research and find a good resource for the skill you&#39;re trying to learn!)</p><p> The starting point is to review your curriculum and figure out:</p><ul><li> What are the lessons you&#39;ll need to watch/read/review?</li><li> What are the practice activities you need to engage in?</li><li> What are the required deliverables (essays/homework) you need to complete?</li><li> How will you need to use the skills and knowledge you&#39;ve gained? Consider things like the format of the final exam as well as where you plan to apply the skills and knowledge you&#39;re learning.</li></ul><p> A pure practice project may be an exception. In this kind of project, you&#39;re not working off materials but trying to practice or implement knowledge you&#39;ve gained elsewhere. For a practice project, you&#39;re creating your own curriculum, so you can choose your own pace. These tend to be more successful when you&#39;ve gone beyond the beginner period and can more successfully guide your own practice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Two: Calculate Your Minimum Time Investment</h2><p> The minimum time investment includes all the work you must put in to complete the class as specified. This includes:</p><ul><li> How long will it take to do the required readings?</li><li> How long will it take to watch any videos/lectures/lessons?</li><li> How long will it take to finish the required deliverables (homework, essays, projects)?</li></ul><p> Videos and recorded lectures are easy to estimate: you can add up the run time of all the videos. Will you be able to <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">watch at an accelerated pace</a> ? If so, you can divide the total by the estimated playback rate (eg, 1.5 or 2 times speed). Otherwise, this time is a fixed amount based on how long the lessons are.</p><p> For required readings, you need an estimate of your reading rate. You can get a first approximation by timing yourself reading a few pages and extrapolating that to the whole book. Read slowly and deliberately; the speed for long reading sessions is inevitably slower than a few-minute sprint.</p><p> Homework is hard to estimate in advance, but you may be able to get an estimate from the course provider, teacher or past students.</p><p> The general idea here is to calculate the minimum time investment to work through the materials you&#39;ve been provided—without any additional studying.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Three: Estimate Additional Studying Time Needs</h2><p> For some classes, simply doing all the work assigned will allow you to pass the test and apply it in real life. But for most classes, you&#39;ll have to go beyond this.</p><p> Some additional places you might expect to invest time are:</p><ul><li> Extra practice questions/homework.</li><li> Application to real-life problems and contexts.</li><li> Creating/reviewing flashcards.</li><li> Self-explanations, such as the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">Feynman Technique</a> .</li><li> Extra research not mentioned in the syllabus.</li></ul><p> A good way to estimate this is by looking at your personal historical data: how much time have you typically needed to invest, beyond the minimum curriculum, to achieve the results you want from the class? There&#39;s no “correct” answer here. Some classes are time-intensive, and the required material is challenging to get through. Other classes are sparse and leave it to students to master the material on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Four: Schedule Studying in Your Calendar</h2><p> Once you have an itemized list of your expected time investment, you need to figure out when you&#39;re actually going to do everything.</p><p> Put any due dates, exams, live lectures or lessons directly in your calendar. For reading, working on homework, practice efforts and other forms of studying, you should still allocate time for them, but there are two different ways to do it:</p><ul><li> <strong>The most rigorous option is to schedule everything as an appointment.</strong> I recommend this approach if studying has to fit inside an already crowded schedule. So if you&#39;re a busy parent and professional studying for a licensing exam, you&#39;d better put studying time directly in your calendar, or it will get pushed to the side in the moment.</li><li> <strong>The more flexible option is to create a weekly or daily routine.</strong> The exact activities in each block would vary depending on your goals, but the time commitments themselves would be relatively routine. For instance, you might decide to study every morning before work, or in the evenings, or on weekends.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Five: Sanity Check</h2><p> At this point in the process, we can do a basic sanity check: how does your calculated time investment from Step Two and Step Three compare with the time you&#39;ve scheduled?   If your available time for the project is less than the estimated minimum, you&#39;ve already got a non-starter. You need to clear more time in your schedule, rethink the aims of the learning project, or expand the timeline you are allowing to complete it.</p><p> If your available time is slightly over what you&#39;ve budgeted, you have little room for error. Getting sick, an unexpectedly challenging topic or a surprise interruption could derail the whole project.</p><p> If you have substantially more time available than you&#39;ve budgeted, that&#39;s not necessarily a sign to relax. With too much slack, you might not feel the pressure to study when you need to and end up wasting time procrastinating. In those cases, I recommend setting soft deadlines that push the work ahead of the more relaxed schedule. This approach can keep the pressure comfortable but challenging, so you have more room for error later.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Six: Getting Feedback</h2><p> Making a plan is the easy part. The hard part is sticking to it. Fortunately, if you keep an eye on the feedback you&#39;re getting while you&#39;re studying and adjust accordingly, the plan you make can be an invaluable guide rather than something that gets tossed aside at the first brush with difficulty.</p><p> Consider these sources of feedback:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Feedback on sticking to your schedule.</h3><p> The first source of feedback is your ability to implement the plan. A helpful strategy is simply to write your intention on an agenda or planner each day and then record what you actually did. For example, you might have intended to study for three hours on Wednesday, but you were interrupted and only got in two hours.</p><p> Whenever there are deviations from your plan, it&#39;s helpful to note the source of the obstacle. Even though you can&#39;t control everything that deflects you from your plan, few obstacles are insurmountable if you can recognize them.考虑：</p><ul><li> <strong>Deviations due to interruptions from others.</strong> Communicate boundaries for your studying time so others appreciate its importance. If you can&#39;t avoid interruptions, find fall-back studying slots in your schedule to make up for occasional, unavoidable interruptions.</li><li> <strong>Deviations from lack of preparation.</strong> Your computer died. You couldn&#39;t log into your account to access the lesson. You had to buy colored pencils. Find a way to do these things before your scheduled session or eliminate them as unnecessary.</li><li> <strong>Deviations because of procrastination/motivation.</strong> Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> , lower your expectations for proficiency in the session to avoid perfectionism, or alternate between reading/practice to avoid mind wandering or boredom.</li></ul><p> Learning is effortful and genuine obstacles can arise, making it hard to stick to one&#39;s plan. However, if you can identify what is causing the interruptions, you can find remedies in many cases.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Feedback on your learning progress.</h3><p> The second source of feedback concerns your progress in learning. Sometimes skills and subjects gel instantly, and you don&#39;t need to review them. In other cases, the new material can seem bewildering and exceed your estimates of how long it will take to master.</p><p> Once again, the key is to observe the feedback and break it down:</p><ul><li> <strong>Are you struggling because the basics aren&#39;t firmly entrenched?</strong> Drills, flashcards and repeated practice on simple problems can help fix this.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you don&#39;t understand a difficult idea?</strong> Self-explanations, talking to teachers/peers/tutors and finding alternative explanatory sources can be helpful.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing wrong or how to improve it?</strong> Seeking coaching, corrective feedback or guidance may be helpful.</li></ul><p> The more granular you can be in identifying your problems, the easier they are to resolve. Zooming in on particular concepts, movements, facts or procedures is the key to getting past difficulties.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Seven: Making Modifications</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve gotten some feedback, you may need to modify your plan. That might involve increasing the hours you invest if you&#39;re falling behind, or you might change your routine so that you can actually invest the hours you said you would.</p><p> In the end, you may not stick to your plan with total rigidity. The primary benefit of planning isn&#39;t to eliminate all improvisation and flexibility. Rather it&#39;s to marshal the resources of time and energy needed to learn and identify obstacles ahead of time so you can avoid most of them. What&#39;s ultimately useful is less the plan itself, but the thinking that goes into creating it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/">Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
