</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>两周前，我请观众向我提出他们的问题。反应很好，所以我决定将我的反应分成两篇文章。你可以<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/07/12/reader-mailbag-range-learning-styles-nootropics/">在这里看到上周的答案</a>，我在其中讨论了<em>范围</em>、学习风格、促智药以及学习你注定要忘记的东西的价值。</p><p>有些问题经过轻微编辑，多人提出的问题已合并为单个问题。 </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Reader-mailbag.jpg" alt=""/></figure><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>如何克服拖延症？</p><p> <cite>（多名读者）</cite></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07">关于拖延症的研究</a>表明，我们之所以无法全身心投入工作（或学习），主要是因为我们发现这项任务令人不愉快，而推迟它比开始工作更能立即获得回报。</p><p>这似乎是一个相当平庸的观察，但重要的是要注意它排除了什么。例如，该研究并未发现完美主义与拖延症（人们普遍认为这一点）密切相关。焦虑也没有明显与更多的拖延相关（如果你焦虑，你甚至可能会更加努力！）。</p><p>在克服拖延方面，我认为这就是为什么开发一个生产力系统（某种指导框架，告诉你该做什么以及何时工作）如此有价值。随着时间的推移，如果你坚持这个系统，做什么的决定就会委托给这个系统，你就会学会遵守它。仅此一点就消除了很多过度的拖延。</p><p>然而，我认为指出拖延通常是有用的也很重要！我们的激励硬件旨在平衡许多相互竞争的利益和需求。一个在病态上无法拖延的人也可能愿意坚持做许多乏味、低价值的任务。</p><p>虽然我们希望将拖延症保持在适应性（而不是适应不良）的水平，但你也应该接受其中的一些，因为你的动机系统正常运作。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您如何看待 Stephen Krashen 的输入假设？</p><p> <cite>（多名读者）</cite></p></blockquote><p>克拉申的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">输入假说</a>是一种有影响力（且有争议）的语言学习理论，认为接触大量可以理解的语言对于完全流利地掌握一门语言是必要且充分的。</p><p>此外，克拉申还主张<em>学习</em>语言和<em>习得</em>语言之间的区别，认为语言不能被练习（因此，鼓励人们说语言没有价值），也不能被教授（因此，语言没有价值）。解释语法或纠正人们的错误）。</p><p>从旁观者的角度来看，我对该理论的流行程度感到有些困惑。考虑：</p><ul><li><strong>对于大多数技能来说，指导往往优于无指导的学习。</strong>语言学习的文献综述表明……<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00663.x">同样</a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00562.x">的</a><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229940242_The_Effectiveness_of_Corrective_Feedback_in_SLA_A_Meta-Analysis">事情</a>？然而，这一证据被克拉申观点的支持者驳回，认为它证明了“学习”而不是“习得”。</li><li><strong>在纯输入学习环境中的人们<a href="https://scirp.org/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=476681">往往无法获得母语水平的语言流畅性</a>。</strong>这表明沉浸式学习的口语部分并不是多余的。</li><li><strong>尽管有数十年的全职接触，10-14 岁以上的成年人和青少年很少能完全达到母语水平。</strong>克拉申的理论将此归因于“情感过滤器”，它阻止纯粹的输入发挥其魔力。在我看来，这似乎难以置信，这可以解释六岁孩子几乎普遍成功地习得母语，但二十六岁孩子达到母语水平的发音和语法的几率却极其罕见。</li><li><strong>我们已经很清楚如何获得其他技能的隐性、流畅的知识。</strong>为什么同样的技能习得法则不适用于语言学习？即使存在特定于语言的机制，成人语言学习者似乎也可以从技能学习系统中受益。</li></ul><p>在学术界之外，克拉申的理论主要影响语言学习者，他们更喜欢阅读和聆听作为主要学习方法，而不是练习对话。</p><p>尽管<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">我更喜欢这种方法</a>，但我并不反对这种方法。鉴于说外语的机会可能有限，仅仅通过大量阅读和倾听，你可能就能走得很远。即便如此，我认为一些口语练习和正式指导对大多数学习者也有帮助。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我发现自己在焦虑/抑郁中挣扎，这让我更难实现我的主要目标。我应该怎么办？</p><p> <cite>（多名读者）</cite></p></blockquote><p>在所有这些情况下，我的第一个建议是，如果你正在与强迫性、消极的想法作斗争，如果可以的话，寻求治疗，特别是从事<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">认知行为治疗的</a>治疗师，因为它往往有最大的经验支持。</p><p> CBT 的效果往往与药物治疗相似（药物治疗似乎也很有效，因此很多人都从两者中受益）。 CBT 背后的基本理念是，我们可以进入相互强化的反复出现的思维、感觉和行动模式。</p><p>例如，患有社交焦虑症的人可能会对参加聚会有不愉快的感觉。这会引发人们对可能出现问题的生动想象（也许他们说错了话，让自己难堪）。焦虑感不断增强，直到他们取消邀请并呆在家里。这会带来一些暂时的缓解，但它会强化导致这种回避的思想和行为模式，并进一步加剧焦虑。</p><p>学会注意并禁用这些模式可能是减少它们对你的控制的重要一步。如果您无法获得治疗，我建议您阅读更多有关认知行为方法的内容，以便您了解工作的要点。</p><p>不过，我不是临床心理学家，所以我所说的不是医学建议，应该持保留态度。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您认为更有效的方法是什么：按任务管理您的一天还是按时间/日程表管理您的一天？</p><p> <cite>– 塔万</cite></p></blockquote><p>我曾经是 <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/04/08/how-to-finish-your-work-one-bite-at-a-time/">基于任务的方法的全心全意的倡导者：</a>列出每天的待办事项清单并努力完成它直到完成。</p><p>基于任务的方法的好处是它专注于完成工作。我发现当你有一堆可预测的任务需要完成，没有迫切需要为你的项目“做更多”，并且你可能有强烈的拖延冲动时，它很有效。当你的任务完成时结束会激励你完成所有事情，这样你就可以享受一天剩下的时间。</p><p>然而，当您正在处理的项目是开放式的，或者您正在尝试处理的任务很难提前预测时，这种方法可能会很困难。在这些情况下，我依靠固定时间表的方法来提高生产力。</p><p>我认为生产力系统的问题在于可能没有一个好的<em>通用</em>系统。相反，根据您的典型任务和目标，不同的方法效果更好或更差。作为一名大学生，我发现基于任务的系统运作良好。但我发现它在其他环境中会崩溃。同样，当你非常忙碌并且日历上有很多约会时，加州纽波特的<a href="https://www.timeblockplanner.com/">时间限制系统</a>效果很好，但如果你可以在没有它的情况下完成工作，那么它可能会让人觉得大材小用。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我很想了解更多关于遮挡眼睛如何影响运动技能学习的信息。蒙着眼睛或遮住一只眼睛进行练习的钢琴演奏者或网球演奏者。</p><p> <cite>– 奥拉</cite></p></blockquote><p>我不知道！我对运动技能文献的理解比教育心理学其他方面的理解要弱一些。</p><p>我知道，当我学习盲打时，我们在键盘顶部贴了一张纸，然后在下面打字，以防止我们看按键。这会鼓励您查看正在抄写的文档并直接记住关键位置。然而，许多其他技能似乎天生就与视觉/动觉反馈循环相关联，因此蒙住眼睛可能会导致性能因不明目的而恶化（例如，我不会蒙着眼睛从山上滑雪）。</p><p>我可以说，引入新颖的约束通常是将运动模式“转变”到新的平衡的好方法，而这种平衡很难仅通过有意识的努力来实现。有一项有趣的<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02701367.1999.10608029">研究</a>表明，当人们将注意力集中在运动目标而不是运动本身时，他们往往会更好地获得运动技能。这表明巧妙的限制可能有助于你改掉坏习惯。</p><p> _ _

<cite>-吉姆</cite></p></blockquote><p>《范围》对我来说是一本有趣的书，因为在某些方面，我就是这本书的缩影。我学到了很多不相关的东西，也做了很多随机的自我探索。我写一篇关于学习的博客，部分原因是我太善变，无法坚持任何一件事并完全掌握它。</p><p>也就是说，我认为我们需要牢记教育和认知心理学中的一些广泛的实证研究结果：</p><ol><li><strong>学生<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">往往会在更有指导和结构化的课程中学得更好</a>。</strong>尽管非结构化、基于发现的方法很有吸引力，但与更直接的教学方法相比，它们往往表现不佳，除非你为它们做好准备。这并不意味着通过发现来学习是没有用的；而是意味着通过发现来学习是没有用的。简单地说，通过纯粹发现来学习的有效性并没有人们经常声称的证据基础。</li><li><strong>不相关技能之间的转移<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1249779.pdf">往往相当低</a>。</strong>学习大量随机事物可能会有一些好处，但考虑到在仔细控制的研究中几乎完全缺乏“远”转移，我想说举证责任在于声称转移很大的人，而不是相反。</li><li><strong>我不认为定义不明确的技能与定义明确的技能没有什么不同（我认为这就是你在将其与学习有“答案”的东西进行对比时所谈论的内容）。</strong>事实上，学习<em>的</em>很多意义在于明确定义一项技能。如果你什么都不知道，那么问题空间就会很大，并且你不确定大量的可能性。随着您了解更多，您会找到更好的方法来表示问题以及更好的方法来解决问题。</li></ol><p>我不认为成为一名多面手并学习很多东西有什么错。生活不仅仅是为了一个单一的目标而优化。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您有什么建议或策略可以更有效地从您阅读的书籍中学习吗？</p><p> <cite>-伊萨姆</cite></p></blockquote><p>我认为最重要的是多读书。阅读更多可以提高您的流利程度和背景知识，从而提高您的阅读率。人们确实低估了阅读对阅读速度的提高程度。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>学习风格怎么样？成为“视觉学习者”等是真实存在的吗？</p><p> <cite>-芯片</cite></p></blockquote><p>可能不会。</p><p>丹尼尔·威林汉姆（Daniel Willingham）<a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/learning-styles-faq.html">对反对“人有学习风格”这一观点的证据</a>进行了精彩的总结。要成为真正的“风格”，它应该意味着当信息以他们喜欢的方式呈现时，人们会学得更好。研究通常没有发现以这种方式定制信息可以增加学习收益。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我们一次可以学到多少东西？我们应该只选择一件事并达到一定水平，然后继续学习其他东西，还是可以同时学习多种东西？它是否会使我们的大脑超载，或者它是否有能力处理如此多的新信息？</p><p> <cite>-查里莎</cite></p></blockquote><p>您绝对可以在同一时间范围内学习多种内容。大多数中小学教育都是以此为基础的。我倾向于不鼓励同时进行多个自主学习项目，因为大多数人高估了自己可以完成的任务，最终得到了几个薄弱的项目，而不是一个有效的项目。但没有任何认知原因可以阻止它。</p><p>我认为同时学习高度相似的科目会产生问题。我从未尝试过同时学习两种新语言，尽管我建议连续练习多种语言以进行维护。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您是否有任何您确信可以提高注意力和生产力的补充剂？</p><p> <cite>-加雷斯</cite></p></blockquote><p>咖啡因？老实说，其实没什么。</p><p>我不相信促智药可以毫无副作用地发挥作用。为了让促智药有意义，你必须相信大脑<em>可以</em>比它实际工作得更好，但决定其性能的内部刻度盘只是设置得不理想。但为什么进化会形成这样的大脑呢？如果转动旋钮可以提高性能且没有任何负面影响，那么进化就已经做到了这一点。</p><p>我的猜测是，真正的学习/注意力增强剂要么具有明显的下行风险（例如安非他明），要么它们针对特定的缺陷/残疾，但对一般人群无效。我很高兴在这里被证明是错误的，但我首先需要看到很多好的证据。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我住在魁北克，但 30 年前离开，所以我懂一些法语。为几个月后的法国之旅做准备，重新学习法语的最快方法是什么？</p><p> <cite>-哈里什</cite></p></blockquote><p>通过<a href="https://www.italki.com/dashboard">iTalki</a>预订一些辅导时间，然后再次尝试聊天。</p><p>对于再学习来说，大部分问题是流畅度和自信心不高。工作量更少，因为知识可能已经在你的头脑中了——只是不那么自动。一些课程应该可以帮助您感觉更流利，这也将有助于增强信心，而信心是说一门语言的重要组成部分。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>如果您必须重新参加麻省理工学院挑战赛，了解您现在对学习、生产力等科学文献的了解，您会采取哪些不同的做法，为什么？</p><p> <cite>-杰夫</cite></p></blockquote><p>我最初梦想<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">麻省理工学院的挑战</a>是“我想知道你是否能学习麻省理工学院教授的所有计算机科学课程？”然后进一步说道，“我想知道如果我只专注于考试，我个人是否可以在 12 个月内完成。”因此，它有点做作，因为目的是通过考试，而不是获得特定目的的技能。多年来我一直这么说，但如果我的最终目标是找到一份编程工作、创办一家初创公司或成为一名研究人员，那么这个项目看起来会完全不同。</p><p>就我现在所知，我认为有一些弱点可以通过不同的方法来弥补。通过对概念的良好理解，我通过了很多考试。尽管如此，我对代数/微积分的程序知识还是很薄弱，这导致我在物理课程上苦苦挣扎，需要大量数学知识来计算答案。如果我重新完成这个项目，我会进行大量的练习来提高流畅度，也许作为开始挑战本身的先决项目。</p><p>同样，当我做编程项目时，麻省理工学院的计算机科学学位对实际编程的了解很少。这是更多的理论和数学。没关系，但如果我打算在之后立即获得一份编程工作，我会花几个月的时间深入研究一种特定的语言，以确保我能够流畅地实现我所涵盖的许多想法。</p><p>总的来说，我不确定我的学习方式会有多大改变。时间限制并没有留下太多的回旋余地来以截然不同的方式做事。但如果我有学习编程或计算机科学的更广泛目标，我可以想象很多不同的方法，这些方法可能在某些目的上产生更好的结果。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>为什么我喜欢阅读非小说类作品，因为大多数作品都被遗忘了？当我们知道大部分材料都会被遗忘时，为什么我们还要对高中生进行内容“期末考试”测试？</p><p> <cite>-抢</cite></p></blockquote><p>事情被遗忘了，但它们仍然常常以印象派的方式影响着我们。我经常发现我的信念已经转向一个方向，尽管我不再记得争论的确切来源。读书的部分作用是改变你对情况的直觉，而这种直觉并不总是能追溯到其来源。</p><p> _ _ _</p><p>这就是本周的内容。下周，我将解决更多问题，包括克服拖延症、我对语言学习中有争议的输入假设的想法、运动技能等等！</p><p> <a rel="nofollow"

Young</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>我花了很多时间思考我们如何学习。</p><p>我阅读了数百本有关该主题的书籍和文章，并撰写了数十篇论文（以及一<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">本书</a>！），试图总结和综合专家的观点，以找到实现这一目标的最佳方法。但还有很多事情我不知道！</p><p>今天，我不想提供答案，而是想提出一些我仍然存在的问题。我将根据特定主题来构建每个问题，但每个问题都可能涉及影响其他技能和主题的更广泛的问题。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我未解答的问题</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. 当学习历史等广泛的学科时，与新阅读相比，应该花多少时间在检索练习上？</h3><p>我之前写过有关<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1199327">检索练习相对于重读</a>的价值的文章。给学生一篇文章来阅读，他们在自由回忆文章内容时学到的东西比重新阅读一遍要多。</p><p>但这里的研究重点是再次重读同一篇文章。阅读不同的来源怎么样？如果您正在研究像历史这样的广泛主题，您是否通过检索活动或阅读许多其他书籍和资源学到更多信息？</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 外语片先看有字幕好还是无字幕好？</h3><p>假设您正在观看一部用您正在学习的语言拍摄的电影。你还没有达到从第一次观看就可以理解发生了什么的程度。如果您要观看多次，您应该在第一次还是第二次观看时带字幕观看？</p><p>第一次观看的理由是你会理解情节，因此在第二次观看时可以更好地吸收语言。第二次查看的理由是你会更好地关注这些单词并处理它们的含义。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. 您应该从努力解决具有挑战性的数学问题开始还是只是查看说明？</h3><p>这不仅仅是我的问题——这是教育研究中备受争议的领域。马努·卡普尔（Manu Kapur）<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543211019105">富有成效的失败</a>实验主张首先提出难以解决的问题。相比之下，其他人关于<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">认知负荷理论的</a>实验主张从明确的指令开始。</p><p>当你获得专业知识时，这两种理论都支持解决问题，因为它提供了所需的实践。但问题是，初学者不太可能事先知道正确的解决方案，他们是否会从问题优先或示例优先的方法中受益更多。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. 您应该通过抽认卡学习多少新语言单词？</h3><p>我非常喜欢用抽认卡学习词汇。在我的巅峰时期，我有大约 16,000 张普通话卡片，还有几千张韩语和马其顿语卡片。</p><p>通过抽认卡记住单词的中心含义比偶然接触要快得多。然而抽认卡只能教你关于单词需要了解的部分内容。你无法感觉到这个词什么时候可能出现或者它与什么词搭配，你需要练习才能在上下文中识别和使用它。</p><p>我的假设是抽认卡很有用，但只是在一定程度上有用。常见的单词很好学，一些不常见的单词也很好学。但你应该走多远呢？最常见的 100、1000 或 9000 个单词？您应该专注于单一的核心含义还是对自己进行变体测验（例如，一张表示“划分”的卡片与表示“划分”、“除法”、“分裂”等的卡片）</p><p>偶然学习一个新单词几乎总是比刻意学习要慢。尽管如此，它还有一个额外的优势，即完整的上下文，以及对上下文中其他单词的额外练习。在某些时候，“在上下文中”学习单词可能会比死记硬背更有效。问题是这个权衡点出现在哪里。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. 如果您正在学习滑雪或滑雪板，如果您坚持选择轻松的斜坡并完善您的技术，或者选择您可以轻松应对的最陡的斜坡，您会学得更快吗？</h3><p>对于认知技能，人们支持从一开始就采用“正确”的方法。如果你错误地学习了数学算法，以后就很少有机会自我纠正这些知识。</p><p>然而，对于身体技能似乎有不同的思想流派。一所学校会主张在继续之前完善“正确”的技术。这是一种认为马虎的技术以后很难修复的观点，因此应该在接受更困难的挑战之前掌握它。</p><p>另一所学校则认为，一旦你在智力上理解了这项技术，你就会从在困难/变化的情况下练习中获益更多，而不是试图在更简单的环境中完善它。然而，这些复杂的设置可能会引入错误，从而导致长期的麻烦。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. 学习学术计算机科学对于成功的程序员有多大用处？</h3><p>自从我参加<a

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>在上周的文章中，我写到了<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">学习中过于耐心</a>的问题。</p><p>我特别挑选了基于简单、最小习惯的学习项目，例如，每天花五分钟在 Duolingo 上学习一门语言，或者每周写一页小说。</p><p>回顾一下：</p><ul><li>虽然这种方法很流行，但它限制了您可以进行的活动类型，通常会消除最有效的练习类型。</li><li>漫长的时间框架让你很难判断自己是否取得了进步，也很难相应地调整你的方法。</li><li>最后，虽然养成简单的习惯可以成为迈向困难行为的良好垫脚石，但对许多人来说，每天五分钟的例行公事变成了目的地，而不是热身。</li></ul><p>虽然最小习惯方法存在问题，但我应该指出，密集型项目也存在问题！密集型项目很难安排，执行起来具有挑战性，并且可能缺乏足够的空间来长期保留。</p><p>最好的方法不是坚定地坚持某种特定的方式来实现目标，而是了解每种方式的优点和缺点。所以，今天我想探讨一下什么样的学习最小习惯实际上是有用的。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度的习惯有什么好处？</h2><p>只要你能长期坚持，最小习惯的学习方法有两个关键优势：空间和便利。</p><p>间距是指<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">间距效应</a>，这是一个经过充分研究的现象。当我们接触信息的时间间隔较长时，我们会比在较短的时间内接触相同数量的信息时更好地保留信息。因此，在十天内看到一个词汇项目十次会比在一小时内看到它十次产生更持久的记忆。通过在很长的时间内进行学习，最小的习惯可以潜在地利用间隔效应，从而比拥挤的时间表产生更持久的记忆。</p><p>最小习惯的第二个优点是它们很方便。正如我在上一篇文章中提到的，阻止人们培养最低限度的习惯感觉很卑鄙，因为替代方案通常是什么也不做。生活忙碌，学习辛苦，有时你只有十分钟的空闲时间。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15217' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15217' title="当人们有&lt;em>;几种&lt;/em>;学习不同事物的最小习惯时，这一论点就被驳斥了，这表明他们可以一次只做一件事，但很难决定要关注哪件事。"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>考虑到这两个优点，我认为值得研究一下什么类型的学习目标可能适合长期传播的简单、最小的习惯。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度的习惯什么时候应该起作用？</h2><p>根据我的最小习惯心理模型，我希望当练习活动的认知负荷较低并且可以适应较小的时间空间时，它们会起作用。</p><p><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">认知负荷理论</a>背后的基本思想是，信息必须穿过意识体验的狭窄瓶颈才能发生学习。复杂的主题和技能，包含许多信息，必须将它们放在一起才能理解它们，会造成很高的认知负担。这就是学习数学和物理困难的原因之一。</p><p>然而，对于一个受试者来说，认知负荷并不是恒定的！当您学习时，您的大脑会使用分块或检索线索等机制来最大程度地减少工作记忆的负担。例如，当您第一次学习阅读时，它的认知负荷非常高，因为您必须努力识别每个字母。但最终，当你自动识别单词和句子时，阅读的认知负荷会变低。</p><p>新的学习对工作记忆的要求各不相同。 Some skills and concepts are intrinsically higher in cognitive load since they have many new, interacting parts. In contrast, other ideas are essentially isolated from each other and can be learned one at a time.</p><p> Consider learning to calculate quantum-mechanical orbitals in chemistry versus memorizing masses on the periodic table. The former has a lot of pieces of information that all need to be used simultaneously to perform the calculation. In contrast, the memorization task involves (mostly) unrelated facts.</p><p> In light of this, flashcards might help you memorize the periodic masses, but they wouldn&#39;t work well for learning to solve the differential equations to find electron orbitals. The kinds of problems in the calculation task require that you “load” a lot of information into short-term memory so that, for all but the most seasoned chemists, the effective practice activity would look more like a problem set that you must focus on for some time.</p><p> <strong>Minimal habits are probably better for maintaining knowledge and fluency than moving to a new skill frontier.</strong> Continued, repetitive practice spaced over time is ideal for boosting fluency, but it&#39;s less effective for making deliberate adjustments in the presence of corrective feedback.</p><p> Thus, a low-key daily writing habit will probably make writing <em>easier</em> , but it may not help you reach a substantially higher level of proficiency. The latter would presumably require deliberate practice constraints that force you to use styles or structures that don&#39;t come automatically and require a certain amount of focus and effort (and likely some outside feedback). This is difficult, or impossible, to sustain as a minimal habit.</p><p> The other constraint on minimal habits is that the practice activity needs to fit—and be effective—in a sliver of time each day. Thus downhill skiing, for instance, probably can&#39;t be made into a minimal habit by most people since it requires a lengthy trip up a snowy mountain before you can get some runs in. Many skills are difficult to practice minimally because no relevant kind of practice will fit into that timeframe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Examples of Where Minimal Habits Might Work</h2><p> I&#39;ve used minimal habits in the past—both effectively and ineffectively. The theory articulated above spells out where I think they work (and where they fail). In particular, I think minimal habits might work well for:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad subject knowledge.</strong> Daily blog reading, educational YouTube videos or skimming a relevant subreddit will not produce expertise. Still, it can give you good <em>coverage</em> of the main ideas, even if you&#39;d need serious practice to become proficient in using them.</li><li> <strong>Flashcards and memorizing isolated facts.</strong> Things that can be made into atomic, independent pieces of quickly-testable knowledge are also good candidates. I&#39;ve successfully used fragments of time to learn a lot of vocabulary, and it can be good for maintaining knowledge, too.</li><li> <strong>Fluency and maintaining established skills.</strong> Keeping effort minimal can help build fluency with material, a non-trivial part of eventual mastery.</li></ul><p> In contrast, I expect minimal habits to be poorly suited to situations requiring deliberate practice; learning new, complex skills; or when effective practice is not possible within the time/effort constraints demanded by the minimal habit.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that the patient/impatient distinction is often dwarfed by the larger consideration of time actually spent learning. According to <a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">some reasonable estimates</a> , mastery of a language can take 500-2000 hours of classroom time. If you were to follow the five-minutes-per-day approach with a “hard” language, like Mandarin, that would mean almost seventy years before you hit that threshold! If you don&#39;t actually practice enough, even the most efficient learning strategy won&#39;t get you there.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">When are Minimal Habits Useful for Learning?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Problem with Being Too Patient</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15198 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Is patience a vice or a virtue in learning? Some reflections on whether minimal habits are sufficient for mastery.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">The Problem with Being Too Patient</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Mastery is often associated with patience. After all, getting good at things takes a long time, and only those who are in it for the long haul can expect to reach the pinnacle of their craft.</p><p> Given that common association, I found it interesting to hear the opposite perspective from <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pro-Lessons-Father-Claude-Harmon/dp/0307338045">Butch Harmon</a> , Tiger Wood&#39;s coach during the best years of his golfing career:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Those golfers who insist on being patient and letting the game come to them rarely play up to their potential. They play well, maybe win a time or two, but they never reach the great heights their talents dictate. The players who want to learn, get better, and win right now—this second, no waiting—are the ones who exceed their natural abilities and become the game&#39;s great overachievers.</p></blockquote><p> Harmon later goes on to explain why Tiger was one of the least-patient people he had ever met:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> When Tiger wants to do something with his golf swing, he wants it done now. No phasing it in and no long-term planning. Once he decides to make a change, he makes it fully and immediately. Then he works himself ragged until he perfects it, exhibiting little or no patience along the way.</p></blockquote><p> In Harmon&#39;s view, patience was often wishful thinking: the hope of future proficiency preventing you from really working today at what you want to improve.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Five-Minutes-Per-Day Problem and Learning Hard Things</h2><p> Harmon&#39;s quote made me think about a phenomenon I&#39;ve often seen in self-improvement circles. It is the idea that what matters most for learning is doing a tiny bit of something, every day, over a long period of time.</p><p> This approach is exemplified by the language learner who plans to become fluent in a language by playing on Duolingo for five minutes a day, the would-be novelist who commits to writing one page a week, or the aspiring photographer taking one picture a day.</p><p> It feels mean to be discouraging of this approach. After all, most people do nothing toward their aspirations, so doing something, even a little bit, is better than nothing.不是吗？</p><p> However, I can&#39;t help but feel that this approach is akin to the wishful thinking exemplified by Harmon&#39;s “patient” golfers—people who used the slowness of eventual mastery to dodge the demanding work of learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Logic of Minimal Habits</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s probably helpful to revisit why this approach is so popular in self-improvement circles. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">Atomic Habits</a> , a fantastic best-seller written by my friend James Clear, is one of the most obvious proponents of the “start small” approach to self-improvement.</p><p> The logic of habit-building is compelling:</p><ol><li> Starting is hard.</li><li> Small habits are easier to commit to.</li><li> Once you start, it&#39;s easier to ramp up and do more.</li></ol><p> Thus, the logic goes, the person who does ten minutes a day on Duolingo is building momentum for a larger habit of practicing speaking with people. By lowering the bar for entry, they begin the self-improvement process, while having high expectations may have made it too hard to get started.</p><p> Phrased this way, the logic of minimal habits is undeniable. I think it&#39;s an important behavioral technique for getting started with anything, especially when the thing you&#39;re trying to do feels unpleasant. I have used this approach to get back into exercising when I haven&#39;t felt like doing so. I would never criticize someone for starting with smaller, enjoyable habits to break into something they find frustrating or unpleasant but want the outcomes of.</p><p> My concern is with #3. Theoretically, it&#39;s easy to ramp up and do more once you&#39;ve started. But in practice, the minimal habit often becomes the destination, not a warm-up for something bigger. And I&#39;m skeptical that such “patient” approaches to practice will reliably result in substantial improvements.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Effective is the “Patient” Approach to Mastery?</h2><p> I&#39;m not aware of any research that specifically pits “five-minutes-per-day” habits against more typical curricula for skills people want to master. The costs and difficulties of longitudinal studies mean that empirical research is generally somewhat scant over extended time frames.</p><p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> in psychology would seem to support the slower, patient approach. Memories tend to be more durable when there are longer intervals between reviewing information than when the same review is massed together (as when cramming for a test). However, real-world studies of language learning <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/07/learning-fast-or-slow/">tend to find the opposite</a> , finding that more intensive curricula have the edge over more stretched-out approaches.</p><p> My guess is that which approach is more effective, whether five minutes daily or intensive bursts, depends on the exact nature of the skill being learned, the practice activities used, and the knowledge the learner begins with. I suspect that complex skills favor a more intensive approach, whereas broad, knowledge-based subjects tend to favor a more patient approach.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15198' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15198' title="A full discussion of exactly what sorts of skills (or sub-skills) benefit from different learning schedules is outside the scope of this essay. Learning vocabulary via flashcards, for instance, seems well-suited to an extended schedule, but the procedural fluency needed for conversations probably benefits from a more intensive one. Similarly, learning about history by watching recorded lectures can probably be done leisurely, but developing the analytical skills of a historian will require a more focused approach. My point here is that my argument that certain categories of “long-term habits” are ineffective for their purpose shouldn’t be misconstrued as the opposite point that an intensive schedule is always better for acquiring all types of skills."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> However this kind of analysis is probably beside the point because, in general, the sorts of things people do for learning when they opt for a five-minute daily habit are categorically different from those they would do in a typical classroom setting or as part of a focused learning project.</p><p> Here, “patient” approaches suffer from several serious drawbacks:</p><ul><li> <strong>Limited time constrains the types of practice you can do.</strong> In five minutes a day, you can complete an exercise on Duolingo, but meaningful conversation practice needs more time. Watching a video of someone painting can be done in five minutes, but replicating that painting yourself takes more time.</li><li> <strong>A focus on “sustainability” avoids necessary effort</strong> . When you pick activities designed to be sustainable over months or years, there&#39;s a bias against picking anything too effortful or time-consuming. This eliminates a lot of the intense, deliberate practice needed to achieve mastery.</li><li> <strong>Long timeframes make it harder to tell if you&#39;re making progress</strong> . Improvement is evident when you&#39;re learning a lot over a few months. If you&#39;re not making progress, you change your approach. When improvement is something expected to occur years in the future, how do you know if you&#39;re actually getting better at the underlying skill?</li></ul><p> For these reasons, I&#39;m skeptical of many of the proposed plans I&#39;ve heard from readers to achieve mastery via simple, long-term habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Mastery is Slow—and Impatient</h2><p> In his research on <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">deliberate practice</a> , Anders Ericsson articulated the view of mastery that most closely corresponds with my own. He argued that mastery is a slow process, and also an impatient one:</p><ul><li> <strong>Mastery is slow because it takes a long time</strong> . No, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> is not an exception to this. I do think it&#39;s possible to learn more efficiently, and that effectively-designed projects can help people accomplish more than they think possible. But genuine mastery (not just relatively quick intermediacy) requires a long time, and nothing I&#39;ve worked on is an exception to that rule.</li><li> <strong>Mastery is impatient because the work required is deliberate, effortful and striving</strong> . Deliberate practice was Ericsson&#39;s term to describe the kind of learning efforts put in by elite performers in chess, music and athletics. It clearly describes Tiger Woods, Harmon&#39;s most famous student.</li></ul><p> I believe this is true even if you don&#39;t aspire to world-class greatness. Even getting “good enough” requires a level of commitment that&#39;s difficult to reach with minimal habits alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">The Problem with Being Too Patient</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:54:47 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15181 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Flashcards should be the base for learning any memory-intensive subject, mnemonics layered on top (if that).</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Suppose you have to memorize a lot of material—vocabulary words in a new language, terminology for an anatomy class, legal precedents, or dates of historical events.

But it had a number of limitations:</p><ul><li> <strong>It takes time to learn and teach mnemonic methods.</strong> Unlike flashcards, mnemonics is itself a skill that requires considerable practice to get good at. While this may benefit elite mnemonists, it may not be worth the additional investment for those who simply want to learn Spanish, law or anatomy.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics often take a good deal of time, especially for beginners.</strong> It may take a few minutes to create a good link with the keyword method, in which time you could have done several repetitions with flashcards. One study, which equalized the time-on-task between mnemonics and more rote memorization, found that simply increasing repetition provided an advantage over using the mnemonic.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics greatly assist with recall over relatively short intervals, but their benefits might not endure.</strong> This makes mnemonics useful in memory competitions—events that require memorization of highly arbitrary information with near-immediate recall. In contrast, much of what we&#39;re trying to memorize needs to stay in our heads for much longer.</li></ul><p> Flashcards, in contrast, are simple and quick. While all memory fades eventually, the repetitive overlearning caused by flashcards is one of the more durable ways to create long-term learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Direct Retrieval is the End Goal of Learning</h2><p> Empirically, mnemonics are a bit of a mixed bag. Flashcards seem to have the advantage, at least in carefully controlled studies of longer-term recollection in students who aren&#39;t already trained in mnemonic techniques.</p><p> Cognitive theory also lends support to this perspective. A major feature of skill acquisition is that the methods used to achieve a result are not constant. For <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emerging-Minds-Process-Childrens-Thinking-ebook/dp/B000QTD49E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">instance</a> , children learning simple addition start by counting both numbers on their hands, then count from the bigger number and finally retrieve the answer directly.</p><p> As expertise develops, more elaborate methods tend to be replaced by direct retrieval of the answer. This is one reason that expertise can be relatively effortless—instead of going through an elaborate process to get to an answer, you just remember it.</p><p> Mnemonics, in this light, can be seen a little bit like the finger-counting. The vivid imagery acts as a bridge between two concepts that would otherwise be difficult to associate. You can quickly learn the mnemonic and it enabling you to cross over from one idea to the other. However, if you practice enough, the two ideas get directly associated—with no intervening imagery.</p><p> For situations where fluency is particularly important, such as recalling vocabulary words while speaking, the direct retrieval option is perhaps necessary for a majority of words in order to not get bogged down while speaking too much. This suggests that even if you initially learn a word via mnemonics, direct retrieval will eventually take over as it becomes the faster option.</p><p> This suggests that mnemonics are, at best, a temporary measure. They may make learning an association easier, in the short-to-medium term, for words that haven&#39;t been sufficiently overlearned to form a direct association. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15190" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么不兼得？</h2><p> Of course, flashcards and mnemonics are not mutually exclusive. You can use the keyword mnemonic when you first encounter a flashcard and then study it repeatedly. In this way, the temporary bridge offered by the mnemonic may be beneficial to learning.</p><p> This is the approach I&#39;ve used when I&#39;ve had to memorize a lot of material. I start with the keyword mnemonic, when that is relatively easy to do, and follow with a lot of spaced retrieval practice to make the association automatic and robust.</p><p> However, I think it&#39;s worth examining the relative efficacy of the two techniques for a few reasons:</p><ul><li> <strong>Many people get overly excited about mnemonics and use them instead of flashcards.</strong> I think this is often ill-advised for the reasons I&#39;ve articulated above.</li><li> <strong>Sometimes the material isn&#39;t mnemonics-friendly.</strong> I found the keyword mnemonic great for learning vocabulary in European languages—but far less helpful for Asian languages. The “sounds like” method doesn&#39;t easily discriminate between words in Chinese (which all sound like each other much more than they sound like words in English) so the first leg in the bridge is weak. However flashcards continued to work and were my primary tool for learning Chinese and Korean vocabulary.</li><li> <strong>For those not trained in mnemonics, it&#39;s worth asking how much time should be invested in acquiring the skills needed.</strong> While mnemonics have some valid use cases, they are often slow and cumbersome without lots of practice, meaning they are best reserved for situations where they&#39;re likely to be used across many memory-intensive subjects.</li></ul><p> In short, if you are proficient with mnemonics, by all means, use them to supplement your flashcards. If you&#39;re not, or your subject makes using them difficult, or you simply aren&#39;t sure which one to prioritize, stick with the flashcards.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> When is Learning Worth the Effort?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 30 May 2023 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15172 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Do we underinvest in learning? An exploration of the logic of learn-or-delegate decisions.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> One of the few lessons I recall from business school is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/make-or-buy-decision.asp">make-or-buy decision</a> . Big companies often face a choice: should they make something in-house, or outsource it to a supplier?</p><p> The decision depends on many factors, but a big part is cost: will it be cheaper or more reliable if you invest in in-house production? Or does it make more sense to pay someone else to do it?</p><p> Decisions about whether or not to learn something are often similar. For almost any conceivable skill you can:</p><ol><li> Learn to do it yourself.</li><li> Hire someone else to do it.</li><li> Avoid doing it entirely.</li></ol><p> Consider programming. You could learn to write code, hire a programmer to do it for you, or choose work and projects that don&#39;t require you to create software.</p><p> Or language learning. You could learn to speak Mandarin, hire a translator, or avoid doing business with monolingual Mandarin speakers.</p><p> The same choice applies to countless other skills, from understanding the tax code to applying medical advice, repairing drywall or planting a garden. You can learn, outsource or avoid.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Learning Rarely Makes Sense Short-Term</h2><p> One common feature of this problem is that the costs of learning rarely make sense if you&#39;re only thinking about immediate benefits. Even if you&#39;re the smartest person on earth, hiring a Mandarin translator, Java programmer or car mechanic to deal with your problem still takes less time and energy than learning to solve it yourself from scratch.</p><p> Yet, if you already know how to solve a problem, doing it yourself is often (but not always) the most effective option. Hiring people takes time, increases the possibility they won&#39;t understand or be able to deliver what you want and can be more expensive.</p><p> Viewed this way, the optimal point for many learn-or-delegate decisions depends on your prior expertise: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15173" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> This analysis suggests you should do what you&#39;re good at, and delegate what you&#39;re not.</p><p> The major wrinkle in this approach is that <em>your level of expertise isn&#39;t constant</em> . It varies depending on the amount of practice you&#39;ve had on the problem. One of the most famous empirical results is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law_of_practice">power law of practice</a> , suggesting that many aspects of proficiency follow a roughly power-law relationship with the amount of practice.</p><p> The answer to the learn-or-delegate decision doesn&#39;t depend only on your current level of expertise, but also on how often you expect to perform the skill. If you&#39;re currently below the competency threshold where doing it yourself makes sense but will probably use the skill a lot, the total lifetime cost of learning may end up being less than delegating: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15174" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> While I&#39;m using an economic lens here, the reasoning still applies outside your job. How much I enjoy painting as a hobby depends on how good I feel I am at it. Thus there&#39;s often an implicit learn-or-ignore decision with recreational activities that follows the same trade-off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Do We Underinvest in Learning?</h2><p> To summarize, many decisions about learning have the following features:</p><ul><li> Doing it yourself doesn&#39;t initially pass a cost-benefit test.</li><li> The more you practice, the lower the cost becomes.</li><li> Thus whether it&#39;s “worth it” to learn something depends on a far-sighted calculation of how much you&#39;ll need to use the skill.</li></ul><p> Unfortunately our intrinsic motivational system is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/12/14/procrastinate-expert/">remarkably short-term in its focus</a> . Immediate costs or payoffs influence our decision far more than long-term ones. Experiments show people often pay steep discount rates for delayed rewards, in <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-02">ways that are inconsistent</a> with any rational agent (even an extremely impulsive one).</p><p> This suggests we may be underinvesting in learning. We&#39;re disinclined to practice skills that fail an initial cost-benefit analysis—even if our investment of practice would be profitable over the course of our lifetime.</p><p> This insight helped Vat and me while learning other languages. The costs of practicing a language are relatively high when you&#39;re not consistently using it. In the short term, forcing yourself to interact in a new language is also costly. But, if you practice enough, speaking the language of the country you&#39;re visiting becomes easier than sticking entirely within an English bubble. Adults are resourceful and frequently find ways to avoid using an unfamiliar language; the consequence is that few get anything close to the levels of exposure that young children can&#39;t help but get when learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Matthew Effects in Learning</h2><p> Another consequence of this basic model is that we should expect Matthew Effects in learning.</p><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">The Matthew Effect</a> was first coined by sociologists Robert Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in their study of elite scientists. Eminent scientists often get more credit than unknown researchers for similar work, meaning that, over time, eminence tends to compound while less famous academics linger in obscurity.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15172' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15172' title="The name of the effect comes from the parable of the talents in the Gospel of Matthew, &amp;#8220;For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.&amp;#8221;"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Later, psychologist Keith Stanovich applied <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">the same insight to reading</a> . Those with a slight advantage in early reading ability had a slightly reduced cost of reading new material. This lead to them practicing more, further reducing the costs of reading. Given the connection between reading and other forms of learning, he even hypothesized that early reading ability might bootstrap intelligence by making it easier to acquire new skills and knowledge.</p><p> Research bears out Stanovich&#39;s hypothesis. In <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12272">a study looking at identical twins</a> who varied in early reading ability, the slightly more proficient twin later showed gains in intelligence compared with their genetically-identical sibling. Skills beget skills; knowledge begets knowledge.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Specialization and Focusing on Strengths</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s helpful to clarify. I&#39;m not suggesting that since learned skills get easier with practice, we should do everything for ourselves and never delegate.</p><p> This is false, even by the basic logic I&#39;ve spelled out above. Some tasks simply aren&#39;t encountered frequently enough to cross the cost/benefit threshold. I may never have an opportunity to speak Mongolian, so if I ever meet a monolingual Mongolian speaker, I&#39;d be happy to lean on Google Translate.</p><p> Additionally, we can&#39;t consider skills in isolation. Spending time learning one thing is an implicit decision not to learn something else. I could learn French, but that time is taken away from learning Mandarin. I could learn Javascript, but that time can&#39;t also be spent learning Python.</p><p> Ultimately, specialization, not self-sufficiency, is the road to abundance in the world we live in today. We delegate the vast majority of skills in our lives, not because learning them all is impossible, but because getting really good at one thing makes sense when it&#39;s relatively easy to delegate everything else.</p><p> Despite spending years learning programming, I do virtually none of it for my own business. Given that my writing is central to my business, and I don&#39;t have enough time to do all the writing I&#39;d like, hiring other people to do the programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">makes more sense</a> . Those people, in turn, tend to be much further along the expertise curve than I am because they&#39;ve made a similar decision to specialize.</p><p> That being said, there are many instances where skills can&#39;t easily be delegated. I might be able to hire out behind-the-scenes programming for my website, but it doesn&#39;t save effort or cost to hire someone to read the research used to write the articles. If I don&#39;t understand the research, I can&#39;t weave it into the text I&#39;m producing.</p><p> In other cases, delegation is an imperfect or inconvenient substitute for being able to do something yourself. Relying on a translator is not equivalent to being able to speak the language yourself when you move to another country. Being able to read a text isn&#39;t made redundant if someone narrates it to you aloud. Thus being able to speak the language of the country you live in and being able to read are skills that are almost certainly worth mastering.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Thinking about Learning in the Long-Term</h2><p> I find it useful to keep in mind a few things when I face resistance to learning something new:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. How much can I expect this skill to get easier with more practice?</h3><p> One way to estimate this is to look at people with varying degrees of experience. How much effort did it take them to do what you struggle with? The learning curve is quite steep for some skills—you get good relatively quickly. For others, the curve is flat for a long time—you may need to practice for years before you feel it&#39;s worth the effort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. How much would I use the skill if I was better at it?</h3><p> Supposing you could reach the relatively flat part of the practice curve, how much would you use it?</p><p> If you live in a country that speaks a language you don&#39;t know, learning that language would definitely pass the cost-benefit test. Learning a major world language you might use in work or educational contexts probably also does. A niche language that isn&#39;t spoken much … maybe not? In this case, it may only be worth learning if you have a strong intrinsic motivation to learn it.</p><p> If a skill is central to your career, it may easily be worth the cost, even if it is initially difficult for you to learn. In contrast, a career skill that doesn&#39;t fit well with your existing skills may go unused even if you&#39;re nearly an expert—it&#39;s simply cheaper to outsource.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. How much would I enjoy the skill, conditional on being better at it?</h3><p> Economic rewards aren&#39;t the only motivation. If you&#39;re good at something, you tend to enjoy it more and draw personal satisfaction. But that&#39;s more true of some skills than others. You might be particularly proud of being able to paint a realistic landscape but not feel too special about being able to file your taxes quickly.</p><p> Deciding when it makes sense to learn isn&#39;t trivial, but given that our intuitions often give us a misleadingly short-term picture of what&#39;s possible, it can be helpful to think more deeply about it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15151 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Need to learn something difficult?

Of those that do, they often make mistakes that render the plan highly unrealistic—a recipe for future guilt, not future learning.</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to outline how to make a studying plan—and how you can stick to it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Make a Studying Plan?</h2><p> Learning is effortful. Although that effort can be enjoyable, our impulses about what to do in the moment often don&#39;t coincide with what would maximize learning. Indeed, the research shows that students frequently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">choose activities</a> that feel fun but don&#39;t deliver results.</p><p> A good analogy is exercise. While playing a sport or going for a jog can be fun, our brains are designed to avoid unnecessary physical exertion. That&#39;s why you rarely see anyone over the age of ten running down the street unless they&#39;re late for an appointment.</p><p> If you want to develop fitness without injuring yourself, it helps to have a workout plan you can and will stick to, rather than just going to the gym whenever you feel like and working on whatever equipment you stumble into.</p><p> The logic is the same for studying. Having a plan maximizes the chance of investing effort where it counts to create learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step One: Review Your Materials </h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already chosen some class, book, tutorials or other curriculum to guide you. (If you haven&#39;t, the first step is to do your research and find a good resource for the skill you&#39;re trying to learn!)</p><p> The starting point is to review your curriculum and figure out:</p><ul><li> What are the lessons you&#39;ll need to watch/read/review?</li><li> What are the practice activities you need to engage in?</li><li> What are the required deliverables (essays/homework) you need to complete?</li><li> How will you need to use the skills and knowledge you&#39;ve gained? Consider things like the format of the final exam as well as where you plan to apply the skills and knowledge you&#39;re learning.</li></ul><p> A pure practice project may be an exception. In this kind of project, you&#39;re not working off materials but trying to practice or implement knowledge you&#39;ve gained elsewhere. For a practice project, you&#39;re creating your own curriculum, so you can choose your own pace. These tend to be more successful when you&#39;ve gone beyond the beginner period and can more successfully guide your own practice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Two: Calculate Your Minimum Time Investment</h2><p> The minimum time investment includes all the work you must put in to complete the class as specified.这包括：</p><ul><li> How long will it take to do the required readings?</li><li> How long will it take to watch any videos/lectures/lessons?</li><li> How long will it take to finish the required deliverables (homework, essays, projects)?</li></ul><p> Videos and recorded lectures are easy to estimate: you can add up the run time of all the videos. Will you be able to <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">watch at an accelerated pace</a> ? If so, you can divide the total by the estimated playback rate (eg, 1.5 or 2 times speed). Otherwise, this time is a fixed amount based on how long the lessons are.</p><p> For required readings, you need an estimate of your reading rate. You can get a first approximation by timing yourself reading a few pages and extrapolating that to the whole book. Read slowly and deliberately; the speed for long reading sessions is inevitably slower than a few-minute sprint.</p><p> Homework is hard to estimate in advance, but you may be able to get an estimate from the course provider, teacher or past students.</p><p> The general idea here is to calculate the minimum time investment to work through the materials you&#39;ve been provided—without any additional studying.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Three: Estimate Additional Studying Time Needs</h2><p> For some classes, simply doing all the work assigned will allow you to pass the test and apply it in real life. But for most classes, you&#39;ll have to go beyond this.</p><p> Some additional places you might expect to invest time are:</p><ul><li> Extra practice questions/homework.</li><li> Application to real-life problems and contexts.</li><li> Creating/reviewing flashcards.</li><li> Self-explanations, such as the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">Feynman Technique</a> .</li><li> Extra research not mentioned in the syllabus.</li></ul><p> A good way to estimate this is by looking at your personal historical data: how much time have you typically needed to invest, beyond the minimum curriculum, to achieve the results you want from the class? There&#39;s no “correct” answer here. Some classes are time-intensive, and the required material is challenging to get through. Other classes are sparse and leave it to students to master the material on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Four: Schedule Studying in Your Calendar</h2><p> Once you have an itemized list of your expected time investment, you need to figure out when you&#39;re actually going to do everything.</p><p> Put any due dates, exams, live lectures or lessons directly in your calendar. For reading, working on homework, practice efforts and other forms of studying, you should still allocate time for them, but there are two different ways to do it:</p><ul><li> <strong>The most rigorous option is to schedule everything as an appointment.</strong> I recommend this approach if studying has to fit inside an already crowded schedule. So if you&#39;re a busy parent and professional studying for a licensing exam, you&#39;d better put studying time directly in your calendar, or it will get pushed to the side in the moment.</li><li> <strong>The more flexible option is to create a weekly or daily routine.</strong> The exact activities in each block would vary depending on your goals, but the time commitments themselves would be relatively routine. For instance, you might decide to study every morning before work, or in the evenings, or on weekends.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Five: Sanity Check</h2><p> At this point in the process, we can do a basic sanity check: how does your calculated time investment from Step Two and Step Three compare with the time you&#39;ve scheduled?   If your available time for the project is less than the estimated minimum, you&#39;ve already got a non-starter. You need to clear more time in your schedule, rethink the aims of the learning project, or expand the timeline you are allowing to complete it.</p><p> If your available time is slightly over what you&#39;ve budgeted, you have little room for error. Getting sick, an unexpectedly challenging topic or a surprise interruption could derail the whole project.</p><p> If you have substantially more time available than you&#39;ve budgeted, that&#39;s not necessarily a sign to relax. With too much slack, you might not feel the pressure to study when you need to and end up wasting time procrastinating. In those cases, I recommend setting soft deadlines that push the work ahead of the more relaxed schedule. This approach can keep the pressure comfortable but challenging, so you have more room for error later.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Six: Getting Feedback</h2><p> Making a plan is the easy part. The hard part is sticking to it. Fortunately, if you keep an eye on the feedback you&#39;re getting while you&#39;re studying and adjust accordingly, the plan you make can be an invaluable guide rather than something that gets tossed aside at the first brush with difficulty.</p><p> Consider these sources of feedback:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Feedback on sticking to your schedule.</h3><p> The first source of feedback is your ability to implement the plan. A helpful strategy is simply to write your intention on an agenda or planner each day and then record what you actually did. For example, you might have intended to study for three hours on Wednesday, but you were interrupted and only got in two hours.</p><p> Whenever there are deviations from your plan, it&#39;s helpful to note the source of the obstacle. Even though you can&#39;t control everything that deflects you from your plan, few obstacles are insurmountable if you can recognize them.考虑：</p><ul><li> <strong>Deviations due to interruptions from others.</strong> Communicate boundaries for your studying time so others appreciate its importance. If you can&#39;t avoid interruptions, find fall-back studying slots in your schedule to make up for occasional, unavoidable interruptions.</li><li> <strong>Deviations from lack of preparation.</strong> Your computer died. You couldn&#39;t log into your account to access the lesson. You had to buy colored pencils. Find a way to do these things before your scheduled session or eliminate them as unnecessary.</li><li> <strong>Deviations because of procrastination/motivation.</strong> Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> , lower your expectations for proficiency in the session to avoid perfectionism, or alternate between reading/practice to avoid mind wandering or boredom.</li></ul><p> Learning is effortful and genuine obstacles can arise, making it hard to stick to one&#39;s plan. However, if you can identify what is causing the interruptions, you can find remedies in many cases.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Feedback on your learning progress.</h3><p> The second source of feedback concerns your progress in learning. Sometimes skills and subjects gel instantly, and you don&#39;t need to review them. In other cases, the new material can seem bewildering and exceed your estimates of how long it will take to master.</p><p> Once again, the key is to observe the feedback and break it down:</p><ul><li> <strong>Are you struggling because the basics aren&#39;t firmly entrenched?</strong> Drills, flashcards and repeated practice on simple problems can help fix this.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you don&#39;t understand a difficult idea?</strong> Self-explanations, talking to teachers/peers/tutors and finding alternative explanatory sources can be helpful.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing wrong or how to improve it?</strong> Seeking coaching, corrective feedback or guidance may be helpful.</li></ul><p> The more granular you can be in identifying your problems, the easier they are to resolve. Zooming in on particular concepts, movements, facts or procedures is the key to getting past difficulties.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Seven: Making Modifications</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve gotten some feedback, you may need to modify your plan. That might involve increasing the hours you invest if you&#39;re falling behind, or you might change your routine so that you can actually invest the hours you said you would.</p><p> In the end, you may not stick to your plan with total rigidity. The primary benefit of planning isn&#39;t to eliminate all improvisation and flexibility. Rather it&#39;s to marshal the resources of time and energy needed to learn and identify obstacles ahead of time so you can avoid most of them. What&#39;s ultimately useful is less the plan itself, but the thinking that goes into creating it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/">Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 16 May 2023 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15136 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Why do people sometimes abruptly become a better version of themselves?

He wanted to understand why this happens and ask how someone might attempt a similar transformation.</p><p> I&#39;ve witnessed this kind of personality change in others several times, so I believe the phenomenon is real. A number of my friends suddenly became much more motivated, conscientious, organized and ambitious—often translating into better life outcomes for themselves.</p><p> It&#39;s also something I&#39;ve personally experienced. When I was around fifteen, I changed my diet, started waking up early, exercising regularly, reading books and trying various ways to be more productive. While the transition took place over a couple of years rather than a singular moment, it still a rather abrupt directional change in my personality that has culminated in who I am today. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p> Assuming, for a second, that my introspective self-report and anecdotal observations are accurate, I think the reader&#39;s question is important and merits further discussion. Why do people sometimes abruptly become better versions of themselves? Perhaps more importantly, why does it so often seem to fail?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Discovering Self-Actualization</h2><p> For lack of a better term, I&#39;ll call this kind of transformation discovering self-actualization. That sounds vague, but it&#39;s the best way I can describe the experience. If you&#39;re allergic to self-help jargon, perhaps another way of describing it might be “becoming an adult” or “getting your act together.” </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> In my case, I think the changes were triggered by a fundamental restructuring of my belief system. Namely, I began to believe that there is considerable room for autonomy in making decisions over my life and that, if I chose wisely, those decisions could make a big difference in where my life ended up.</p><p> Wanting to start my own business was also a significant trigger. Something about the intrinsic appeal of being my own boss and having complete financial independence, combined with the inherent difficulty in succeeding in that goal, acted as a catalyst. Indeed, I&#39;ve known quite a few people who have discovered self-actualization in the context of professional ambition.</p><p> For other people, the trigger was something more concrete. They read a particular book that changed their worldview ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> , for many). They encountered a new-to-them religion, philosophy or spiritual practice ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a> seems to be another common trigger for change).</p><p> Even if the exact cause is idiosyncratic, I see a few common features:</p><ul><li> <strong>A belief that there are lives better than the one we are currently living.</strong> The central premise is that there&#39;s a broad array of possible futures, and many of them are better than the default. This seems to hold even in philosophical views that reject most kinds of ambition. For instance, those interested in mindfulness meditation often spurn the idea that career ambitions should be made central to life. But they still believe that mindfulness will let them experience a better quality of life.</li><li> <strong>A sudden, pervasive increase in self-efficacy.</strong> While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura&#39;s original concept</a> was decidedly granular, there do appear to be moments where you become more confident in succeeding at a broader range of actions.</li><li> <strong>Increased valuation of delaying gratification and resisting impulses.</strong> The willingness to work hard, do things that make you feel uncomfortable and resist your immediate habits and impulses is also at work. Over a relatively short period, someone who might have struggled with sticking to an exercise program is suddenly taking on dozens of high-effort challenges.</li><li> <strong>(Over)zealous application of the above changes.</strong> Often, people who experience a major paradigm shift are overly optimistic about the value of alternate versions of their life, overly confident about their ability to execute, and overly focused on self-improvement over momentary gratification.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Skeptic&#39;s Critique</h2><p> Of course, I&#39;m far from the first to notice this phenomenon. A lot of self-help gurus have built their entire marketing empires around selling people transformative life change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">Tony Robbins</a> , in particular, seems to make a big deal about these kinds of moments.</p><p> The skeptic would argue that these kinds of changes don&#39;t typically last. Hype fades, and while getting excited about something is easy, we rarely change our personality or behavior permanently.</p><p> I tend to agree with the skeptic—most of the time. I suspect that most people experience one or, maybe, two of these shifts in their entire life. Many people may never experience it. Change, instead, is generally gradual and directionless. Sometimes we get in a bit better shape, sometimes we let ourselves go. Most bursts of self-improvement revert to the mean.</p><p> However, given the significance of these dramatic shifts, we shouldn&#39;t round their probability to zero. Experiencing such a moment once or twice in your life might make up for dozens of other fizzled attempts at bettering yourself.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么会发生这种情况？ Why Does it Fail?</h2><p> My speculative theory of these kinds of personal transformations is:</p><ul><li> <strong>There&#39;s a temporary change in your optimism, confidence and valuing of effort.</strong> This kind of momentary effect can come from reading a self-help book, having a role model who inspires you to work at something, or having a private epiphany.</li><li> <strong>The environment creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.</strong> The easiest way to see this kind of positive feedback loop would be setting a goal, achieving it, and suddenly biasing your other estimates of self-efficacy or confidence upward.</li><li> <strong>Once the initial feedback loop wears off, you&#39;re already in a sufficiently “different” position for your life.</strong> Your habits and material circumstances of personal identity have shifted to a new equilibrium position, and you now maintain it.</li></ul><p> Under this theory, most self-improvement efforts fizzle because the momentary burst of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, and the equilibrium you reach is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">metastable</a> . Eventually you decay back to the person you were before because a lot of gravity is pulling you back that way.</p><p> Even when this kind of transformative change occurs, I think there are probably limits on how far it can go. People&#39;s <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">beliefs about their malleability</a> vary wildly around the actual figure. Some people suddenly become incredibly optimistic about their ability to become popular, successful, smart, enlightened, etc., as well as the converse, where people adopt a fixed view of themselves and believe change is impossible.</p><p> The transformations I&#39;ve witnessed in other people tend to involve modestly unrealistic beliefs. This raises an interesting question of whether some amount of self-delusion helps in crossing over into a new equilibrium, even if it&#39;s unsustainable. Were that true, though much-maligned by skeptics, this small break from reality may actually be key—a truly sober assessment of one&#39;s possibilities may not encourage enough of a transitory change in your beliefs to shift over to a new equilibrium.</p><p> At the same time, it also seems clear that most changes are not of this magnitude. Discovering that you can take charge of your life is probably something you can only really do once or twice in your life. Once that&#39;s firmly established in your beliefs, further adjustments are probably minor in comparison—tweaks to your habits, skills or perspective.</p><p> Since the world is flush with people pitching and persuading others to adopt a self-actualization belief set (even if it is partly delusional), a related question is why such transformations are relatively rare. My suspicion is that they&#39;re harder to sustain because while it&#39;s easy to find sources of inspiration, it&#39;s much harder to locate the positive feedback loops that keep the motivation going.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Can You Trigger a Change in Yourself?</h2><p> Given that many of us would like to have a sudden, positive shift in the direction of our lives, is there anything we can do to facilitate this kind of transition? </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。 While I&#39;ve witnessed it many times, the change itself happens as a by-product of something else rather than the person actively seeking it out.</p><p> However, I do think there are a few generic ingredients that may increase the likelihood of such a change:</p><ul><li> <strong>Success with self-set ambitions.</strong> Self-efficacy seems to be a crucial motivational component here. It&#39;s not enough to know that building a business, learning a language or getting in shape is possible. You have to believe <em>you</em> could do it. While achieving one thing doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to across-the-board motivation, having more success is likely to encourage increased self-efficacy.</li><li> <strong>Reading a lot of books with inspiring-but-credible messages.</strong> If modest self-delusion plays a role in initiating these transitions, the temporary boost you get from reading motivational material may increase your chances of hitting an inflection point. But inspiration fails if you don&#39;t believe it. Hence, finding optimistic sources that seem credible to you is more important than just picking the cheesiest self-help title.</li><li> <strong>Finding challenging, worthwhile goals.</strong> At least in my own case, I felt like the desire to start a business was a catalyst. The combination of an attractive goal and knowing I wouldn&#39;t succeed unless I worked really hard seemed vital.</li><li> <strong>More randomness.</strong> A final catalyst is having experiences that take you outside your comfort zone. The idea here is that greater variability in your day-to-day experience increases the likelihood of stumbling upon a positive feedback loop that alters your course in life.</li></ul><p> In the end, I&#39;m not entirely sure why some people become obsessed with personal productivity, mindfulness meditation, exercising daily, building a business or becoming a straight-A student. I don&#39;t know why the direction of their life seems to pivot abruptly after a particular experience. But I agree with the reader who emailed me that even if such transitions are rare, they seem important and poorly understood.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/">Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 04:41:23 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15111 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> My pick for the best ten books on learning how to learn better!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/">Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What are the best books to read to become a better learner?

While Ashman&#39;s advice—that teachers should fully and thoroughly teach their subjects—don&#39;t sound surprising, it&#39;s an important message because of the alternative theories it rejects.

Deliberate practice has become a buzzword in many circles, but this buzz has also created considerable misconceptions.</p><p> In this book, Ericsson works to set the record straight, arguing both for what deliberate practice is and what it isn&#39;t. Ericsson argues that much of the prowess we see in elite performers is due to huge quantities of this specific kind of practice rather than talent alone.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Move-Revolution/dp/B09KDSQD9Q">How We Learn to Move</a> by Rob Gray</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Learn-Move-Revolution/dp/B09KDSQD9Q"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/51Bs22c3hfL-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15123" width="150" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/51Bs22c3hfL-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/51Bs22c3hfL-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/51Bs22c3hfL-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/51Bs22c3hfL.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></figure></div><p> Movement skills have been a gap in my writing on learning.
