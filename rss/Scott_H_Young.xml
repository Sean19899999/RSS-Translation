</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>我花了很多时间思考我们如何学习。</p><p>我阅读了数百本有关该主题的书籍和文章，并撰写了数十篇论文（以及一<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">本书</a>！），试图总结和综合专家的观点，以找到实现这一目标的最佳方法。但还有很多事情我不知道！</p><p>今天，我不想提供答案，而是想提出一些我仍然存在的问题。我将根据特定主题来构建每个问题，但每个问题都可能涉及影响其他技能和主题的更广泛的问题。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我未解答的问题</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. 当学习历史等广泛的学科时，与新阅读相比，应该花多少时间在检索练习上？</h3><p>我之前写过有关<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1199327">检索练习相对于重读</a>的价值的文章。给学生一篇文章来阅读，他们在自由回忆文章内容时学到的东西比重新阅读一遍要多。</p><p>但这里的研究重点是再次重读同一篇文章。阅读不同的来源怎么样？如果您正在研究像历史这样的广泛主题，您是否通过检索活动或阅读许多其他书籍和资源学到更多信息？</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 外语片先看有字幕好还是无字幕好？</h3><p>假设您正在观看一部用您正在学习的语言拍摄的电影。你还没有达到从第一次观看就可以理解发生了什么的程度。如果您要观看多次，您应该在第一次还是第二次观看时带字幕观看？</p><p>第一次观看的理由是你会理解情节，因此在第二次观看时可以更好地吸收语言。第二次查看的理由是你会更好地关注这些单词并处理它们的含义。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. 您应该从努力解决具有挑战性的数学问题开始还是只是查看说明？</h3><p>这不仅仅是我的问题——这是教育研究中备受争议的领域。马努·卡普尔（Manu Kapur）<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543211019105">富有成效的失败</a>实验主张首先提出难以解决的问题。相比之下，其他人关于<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">认知负荷理论的</a>实验主张从明确的指令开始。</p><p>当你获得专业知识时，这两种理论都支持解决问题，因为它提供了所需的实践。但问题是，初学者不太可能事先知道正确的解决方案，他们是否会从问题优先或示例优先的方法中受益更多。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. 您应该通过抽认卡学习多少新语言单词？</h3><p>我非常喜欢用抽认卡学习词汇。在我的巅峰时期，我有大约 16,000 张普通话卡片，还有几千张韩语和马其顿语卡片。</p><p>通过抽认卡记住单词的中心含义比偶然接触要快得多。然而抽认卡只能教你关于单词需要了解的部分内容。你无法感觉到这个词什么时候可能出现或者它与什么词搭配，你需要练习才能在上下文中识别和使用它。</p><p>我的假设是抽认卡很有用，但只是在一定程度上有用。常见的单词很好学，一些不常见的单词也很好学。但你应该走多远呢？最常见的 100、1000 或 9000 个单词？您应该专注于单一的核心含义还是对自己进行变体测验（例如，一张表示“划分”的卡片与表示“划分”、“除法”、“分裂”等的卡片）</p><p>偶然学习一个新单词几乎总是比刻意学习要慢。尽管如此，它还有一个额外的优势，即完整的上下文，以及对上下文中其他单词的额外练习。在某些时候，“在上下文中”学习单词可能会比死记硬背更有效。问题是这个权衡点出现在哪里。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. 如果您正在学习滑雪或滑雪板，如果您坚持选择轻松的斜坡并完善您的技术，或者选择您可以轻松应对的最陡的斜坡，您会学得更快吗？</h3><p>对于认知技能，人们支持从一开始就采用“正确”的方法。如果你错误地学习了数学算法，以后就很少有机会自我纠正这些知识。</p><p>然而，对于身体技能似乎有不同的思想流派。一所学校会主张在继续之前完善“正确”的技术。这是一种认为马虎的技术以后很难修复的观点，因此应该在接受更困难的挑战之前掌握它。</p><p>另一所学派则认为，一旦你在智力上理解了这项技术，你就会从在困难/变化的情况下练习中获益更多，而不是试图在更简单的环境中完善它。然而，这些复杂的设置可能会引入错误，从而导致长期的麻烦。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. 学习学术计算机科学对于成功的程序员有多大用处？</h3><p>自从我参加<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">麻省理工学院挑战赛</a>以来，这个问题一直萦绕在我的脑海里。一方面，数论、算法和逻辑分析等知识在编程实践中发挥作用。另一方面，谁曾在开始解决问题之前坐下来证明问题的复杂性等级？</p><p>学术理论与实践技能之间的关系问题出现在许多领域。对于学术相关性的看法多种多样，“当然，你需要学习这一点！”到，“没有人在工作中使用过这个。”</p><p>可能的答案包括：</p><ul><li>它有帮助，但主要是针对高级工作，而不是入门级工作。</li><li>它通过使实践技能“有意义”来帮助未来的学习。</li><li>它对编程没有多大帮助，但可以帮助你找到工作。</li><li>比直接学习编程效率要低。</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. 通过下较慢的棋局还是较快的棋局，你的棋艺水平会提高吗？</h3><p>假设你想快速提高你的国际象棋成绩。你应该专注于较长的游戏，其中有更多的时间来思考每一步，还是更快的游戏，虽然思考的时间较少，但你最终会在玩游戏的每个小时中看到更多的棋盘位置。</p><p>我怀疑两端都有一个极端，即学习效益会崩溃。每场比赛花费一年的时间，或者每次移动花费不到一秒的时间，可能效率不高。但最佳点位于两者之间的哪里呢？</p><p>当然，虽然这个问题对国际象棋很重要，但明确回答它会说明很多其他技能，这些技能可以以不同的“速度”完成，并且在分析深度和暴露数量之间进行权衡。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8、如果你想画“松”的风格，是否应该先学会“紧”控制的画？</h3><p>与下棋的快慢类似，也是艺术风格培养的问题。假设你想以“宽松”或“绘画式”的方式绘画。是否应该先以更大的控制力学习，然后随着经验的积累而放松，或者从一开始就应该相对宽松地绘画？</p><p>从更大的控制开始的论点是，我们喜欢熟练、宽松的绘画风格的大部分原因是艺术家可以通过经济的动作和笔触进行大量交流。初学者做不到这一点，所以他们最好学习基础知识并随着水平的提高而放松。</p><p>可以用数学来类比：经验丰富的数学家可以简单地说出一个复杂问题的答案，而初学者则需要手动进行缓慢的计算才能得到相同的答案。我们永远不会指望仅仅喊出答案就能成为初学者获得专家知识的一种方式。</p><p>主张从宽松开始的论点是，受控绘画的技巧不同于宽松的作品。因此，从风格上来说，早期对控制的关注可能会让以后更难发展出成功的、宽松的风格。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">您还有哪些未解答的问题？</h2><p>这些是我的一些未解答的问题——你的呢？在学习的过程中，你还有什么不明白的地方吗？您对我提出的问题有什么看法吗？请分享您的想法！</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/27/unanswered-questions/">关于最佳学习方式的“我的八个未解答的问题”</a>一文首先出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/27/unanswered-questions/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>最低限度习惯什么时候对学习有用？</title><link/> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/<comments> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 15:24:27 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/?p=15217 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>早些时候，我批评了每天五分钟的学习方法。现在让我们看看缓慢而耐心的方法实际上可以在哪里发挥作用。</p><p>帖子《<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">最低限度的习惯什么时候对学习有用？》</a>首次出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>在上周的文章中，我写到了<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">学习中过于耐心</a>的问题。</p><p>我特别挑选了基于简单、最小习惯的学习项目，例如，每天花五分钟在 Duolingo 上学习一门语言，或者每周写一页小说。</p><p>回顾一下：</p><ul><li>虽然这种方法很流行，但它限制了您可以进行的活动类型，通常会消除最有效的练习类型。</li><li>漫长的时间框架让你很难判断自己是否取得了进步，也很难相应地调整你的方法。</li><li>最后，虽然养成简单的习惯可以成为迈向困难行为的良好垫脚石，但对许多人来说，每天五分钟的例行公事变成了目的地，而不是热身。</li></ul><p>虽然最小习惯方法存在问题，但我应该指出，密集型项目也存在问题！密集型项目很难安排，执行起来具有挑战性，并且可能缺乏足够的空间来长期保留。</p><p>最好的方法不是坚定地坚持某种特定的方式来实现目标，而是了解每种方式的优点和缺点。所以，今天我想探讨一下什么样的学习最小习惯实际上是有用的。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度的习惯有什么好处？</h2><p>只要你能长期坚持，最小习惯的学习方法有两个关键优势：空间和便利。</p><p>间距是指<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">间距效应</a>，这是一个经过充分研究的现象。当我们接触信息的时间间隔较长时，我们会比在较短的时间内接触相同数量的信息时更好地保留信息。因此，在十天内看到一个词汇项目十次会比在一小时内看到它十次产生更持久的记忆。通过在很长的时间内进行学习，最小的习惯可以潜在地利用间隔效应，从而比拥挤的时间表产生更持久的记忆。</p><p>最小习惯的第二个优点是它们很方便。正如我在上一篇文章中提到的，阻止人们培养最低限度的习惯感觉很卑鄙，因为替代方案通常是什么都不做。生活忙碌，学习辛苦，有时你只有十分钟的空闲时间。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15217' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15217' title="当人们有&lt;em>;几种&lt;/em>;学习不同事物的最小习惯时，这一论点就被驳斥了，这表明他们可以一次只做一件事，但很难决定要关注哪件事。"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>考虑到这两个优点，我认为值得研究一下什么类型的学习目标可能适合长期传播的简单、最小的习惯。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度的习惯什么时候应该起作用？</h2><p>根据我的最小习惯心理模型，我希望当练习活动的认知负荷较低并且可以适应较小的时间空间时，它们会起作用。</p><p><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">认知负荷理论</a>背后的基本思想是，信息必须穿过意识体验的狭窄瓶颈才能发生学习。复杂的主题和技能，包含许多信息，必须将它们放在一起才能理解它们，会造成很高的认知负担。这就是学习数学和物理困难的原因之一。</p><p>然而，对于一个受试者来说，认知负荷并不是恒定的！当您学习时，您的大脑会使用分块或检索线索等机制来最大程度地减少工作记忆的负担。例如，当您第一次学习阅读时，它的认知负荷非常高，因为您必须努力识别每个字母。但最终，当你自动识别单词和句子时，阅读的认知负荷会变低。</p><p>新的学习对工作记忆的要求各不相同。有些技能和概念本质上认知负荷较高，因为它们有许多新的、相互作用的部分。相比之下，其他想法本质上是相互独立的，可以一次学习一个。</p><p>考虑学习计算化学中的量子力学轨道与记住元素周期表上的质量。前者有很多信息，需要同时使用来执行计算。相反，记忆任务涉及（大部分）不相关的事实。</p><p>有鉴于此，抽认卡可能会帮助您记住周期质量，但对于学习求解微分方程以找到电子轨道来说，它们并不能很好地发挥作用。计算任务中的各种问题要求您将大量信息“加载”到短期记忆中，因此，对于除了经验最丰富的化学家之外的所有人来说，有效的练习活动看起来更像是您必须关注的问题集一段时间了。</p><p><strong>最少的习惯可能比转向新的技能领域更能保持知识和流畅性。</strong>随着时间的推移，持续、重复的练习对于提高流利度来说是理想的选择，但在存在纠正反馈的情况下进行刻意调整的效果较差。</p><p>因此，低调的日常写作习惯可能会让写作变得<em>更容易</em>，但它可能不会帮助你达到更高的熟练程度。后者可能需要刻意的练习限制，迫使您使用不会自动出现的样式或结构，并且需要一定的关注和努力（可能还需要一些外部反馈）。作为一个最低限度的习惯，这是很难或不可能维持的。</p><p>最低限度习惯的另一个限制是练习活动需要适合每天的一小部分时间并且有效。因此，例如，速降滑雪可能无法成为大多数人的最低习惯，因为它需要在雪山上进行长途旅行才能进行跑步。许多技能很难进行最低限度的练习，因为没有相关的种类练习将适合该时间范围。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最小习惯可能发挥作用的一些例子</h2><p>我过去曾使用过一些极简的习惯——无论有效还是无效。上面阐述的理论阐明了我认为它们有效的地方（以及它们失败的地方）。特别是，我认为最低限度的习惯可能对以下方面很有效：</p><ul><li><strong>广泛的学科知识。</strong>每天阅读博客、YouTube 教育视频或浏览相关 Reddit 子版块不会产生专业知识。尽管如此，它仍然可以让您很好地<em>涵盖</em>主要思想，即使您需要认真练习才能熟练使用它们。</li><li><strong>抽认卡和记忆孤立的事实。</strong>那些可以被制作成原子的、独立的、可快速测试的知识的东西也是不错的候选者。我成功地利用碎片时间学习了大量的词汇，这对于维持知识也有好处。</li><li><strong>流利并保持既定技能。</strong>保持最少的努力可以帮助培养对材料的流畅性，这是最终掌握的一个重要部分。</li></ul><p>相比之下，我认为最低限度的习惯不太适合需要刻意练习的情况。学习新的、复杂的技能；或者在最低习惯要求的时间/精力限制内不可能进行有效的练习。</p><p>值得注意的是，耐心/不耐心的区别往往与实际学习时间的更大考虑相形见绌。根据<a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">一些合理的估计</a>，掌握一门语言可能需要 500-2000 小时的课堂时间。如果你遵循每天五分钟的方法，使用像普通话这样的“硬”语言，那意味着你还需要将近七十年才能达到这个门槛！如果你实际上没有足够的练习，即使是最有效的学习策略也无法让你达到目标。</p><p>帖子《<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">最低限度的习惯什么时候对学习有用？》</a>首次出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>过于耐心的问题</title><link/>https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-病人/<comments> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patent/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/?p=15198 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>耐心是学习的恶习还是美德？关于最少的习惯是否足以掌握的一些思考。</p><p>帖子<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">“过于耐心的问题”</a>首先出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>精通通常与耐心联系在一起。毕竟，做好一件事需要很长时间，只有长期坚持下去的人才能达到技艺的顶峰。</p><p>考虑到这种共同的联想，我发现很有趣的是，在老虎·伍德高尔夫生涯最好的几年里，他的教练<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pro-Lessons-Father-Claude-Harmon/dp/0307338045">布奇·哈蒙</a>听到了相反的观点：</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>那些坚持保持耐心并让比赛自行其是的高尔夫球手很少能发挥出自己的潜力。他们打得很好，也许赢了一两次，但他们从未达到他们的天赋所要求的伟大高度。那些想要立即学习、变得更好并赢得胜利的玩家——就在这一秒，无需等待——就是那些超越自己自然能力并成为游戏中伟大成就者的人。</p></blockquote><p>哈蒙后来解释了为什么老虎是他见过的最没有耐心的人之一：</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>当泰格想要用他的高尔夫挥杆做某事时，他希望现在就完成。没有分阶段实施，也没有长期规划。一旦他决定做出改变，他就会立即彻底地做出改变。然后他衣衫褴褛地工作，直到完美为止，一路上几乎没有耐心。</p></blockquote><p>在哈蒙看来，耐心往往是一厢情愿的想法：对未来熟练程度的希望会阻止你今天真正致力于你想要提高的事情。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">每天五分钟的问题和学习困难的事情</h2><p>哈蒙的话让我想起了我在自我完善圈子里经常看到的一个现象。这种观点认为，对于学习来说，最重要的是在很长一段时间内每天做一点点事情。</p><p>这种方法的例子有：计划通过每天在 Duolingo 上玩五分钟来流利掌握一门语言的语言学习者、承诺每周写一页的未来小说家、或者每天拍摄一张照片的有抱负的摄影师。</p><p>阻止这种方法感觉很刻薄。毕竟，大多数人都没有为自己的愿望做任何事，所以做点什么，哪怕是一点点，也比什么都不做要好。不是吗？</p><p>然而，我不禁觉得这种方法类似于哈蒙的“耐心”高尔夫球手所体现的一厢情愿——他们利用最终掌握的缓慢来逃避艰巨的学习工作。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度习惯的逻辑</h2><p>此时，重新审视为什么这种方法在自我完善圈子中如此流行可能会有所帮助。 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">《原子习惯》</a>是我的朋友詹姆斯·克利尔写的一本精彩的畅销书，他是“从小事做起”自我完善方法最明显的支持者之一。</p><p>养成习惯的逻辑很引人注目：</p><ol><li>开始很难。</li><li>小习惯更容易养成。</li><li>一旦开始，就更容易提升并做更多事情。</li></ol><p>因此，按照逻辑，每天在 Duolingo 上花十分钟的人正在为练习与人交谈的更大习惯建立动力。通过降低进入门槛，他们开始了自我完善的过程，而过高的期望可能会让他们很难开始。</p><p>这样说来，最低限度习惯的逻辑是不可否认的。我认为这是开始做任何事情的重要行为技巧，尤其是当你想做的事情感觉不愉快时。当我不想锻炼时，我就用这种方法重新开始锻炼。我永远不会批评某人从较小的、令人愉快的习惯开始，闯入他们认为令人沮丧或不愉快但想要结果的事情。</p><p>我关心的是#3。从理论上讲，一旦开始，就很容易提高并做更多的事情。但在实践中，最小的习惯往往会成为目标，而不是为更大的事情做准备。我怀疑这种“耐心”的实践方法能否可靠地带来实质性的改进。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> “耐心”的掌握方法有多有效？</h2><p>我不知道有任何研究专门将“每天五分钟”的习惯与人们想要掌握的技能的更典型的课程进行比较。纵向研究的成本和困难意味着在较长时间范围内的实证研究通常有些缺乏。</p><p>心理学上的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">间隔效应</a>似乎支持缓慢、耐心的方法。当复习信息之间的间隔较长时，记忆往往比当相同的复习集中在一起时（例如临时抱佛脚考试时）更持久。然而，现实世界的语言学习研究<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/07/learning-fast-or-slow/">往往发现相反的结果</a>，即更密集的课程比更延伸的方法更有优势。</p><p>我的猜测是，哪种方法更有效，是每天五分钟还是密集爆发，取决于所学技能的确切性质、所使用的练习活动以及学习者开始学习的知识。我怀疑复杂的技能倾向于更深入的方法，而广泛的、基于知识的科目倾向于更耐心的方法。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15198' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15198' title="全面讨论到底哪些类型的技能（或子技能）从不同的学习计划中受益超出了本文的范围。例如，通过抽认卡学习词汇似乎很适合延长日程，但对话所需的程序流畅性可能会受益于更密集的对话。同样，通过观看录制的讲座来学习历史可能可以悠闲地完成，但培养历史学家的分析能力将需要更有针对性的方法。我在这里的观点是，我认为某些类别的“长期习惯”对其目的无效的论点不应被误解为相反的观点，即密集的日程安排总是更适合获得所有类型的技能。"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p>然而，这种分析可能不是重点，因为一般来说，当人们选择每天五分钟的习惯时，他们为学习所做的事情与他们在典型的课堂环境中或作为学习的一部分所做的事情截然不同。一个有重点的学习项目。</p><p>在这里，“耐心”的方法有几个严重的缺点：</p><ul><li><strong>有限的时间限制了你可以进行的练习类型。</strong>每天五分钟，你就可以在 Duolingo 上完成一项练习，但有意义的对话练习需要更多时间。观看某人绘画的视频可以在五分钟内完成，但自己复制这幅画需要更多时间。</li><li><strong>对“可持续性”的关注避免了必要的努力</strong>。当您选择可持续数月或数年的活动时，人们会倾向于选择过于费力或耗时的活动。这消除了达到精通所需的大量激烈、刻意的练习。</li><li><strong>较长的时间范围会让你更难判断自己是否取得了进展</strong>。当您在几个月内学到很多东西时，进步是显而易见的。如果你没有取得进步，你就改变你的方法。当预计在未来几年内会出现改进时，您如何知道您的基本技能是否真的得到了提高？</li></ul><p>出于这些原因，我对读者提出的通过简单、长期的习惯来掌握的许多计划持怀疑态度。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">掌握是缓慢且不耐烦的</h2><p>安德斯·埃里克森（Anders Ericsson）在他对<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">刻意练习的</a>研究中阐述了与我的观点最接近的掌握观点。他认为掌握是一个缓慢的过程，也是一个不耐烦的过程：</p><ul><li><strong>掌握很慢，因为需要很长时间</strong>。不，<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">我的书</a>也不例外。我确实认为更有效地学习是可能的，并且有效设计的项目可以帮助人们完成比他们想象的更多的事情。但真正的掌握（不仅仅是相对快速的中间过程）需要很长时间，而我所做的一切都不例外。</li><li><strong>精通是不耐烦的，因为所需的工作是深思熟虑、努力和奋斗的</strong>。埃里克森用“刻意练习”一词来描述国际象棋、音乐和体育领域的精英运动员所付出的学习努力。它清楚地描述了哈蒙最著名的学生泰格·伍兹。</li></ul><p>我相信即使你不渴望成为世界级的伟大人物，这也是事实。即使要“足够好”，也需要一定程度的承诺，而仅靠最低限度的习惯是很难达到的。</p><p>帖子<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">“过于耐心的问题”</a>首先出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patent/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>为什么抽认卡比助记符更适合学习</title><link/>https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/<comments> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:54:47 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scothyoung.com/blog/?p=15181 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>抽认卡应该是学习任何记忆密集型科目的基础，助记符位于最上面（如果是的话）。</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">为什么抽认卡比助记符更适合学习，</a>这篇文章首先出现在<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>;

They may make learning an association easier, in the short-to-medium term, for words that haven&#39;t been sufficiently overlearned to form a direct association. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15190" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Not Both?</h2><p> Of course, flashcards and mnemonics are not mutually exclusive. You can use the keyword mnemonic when you first encounter a flashcard and then study it repeatedly. In this way, the temporary bridge offered by the mnemonic may be beneficial to learning.</p><p> This is the approach I&#39;ve used when I&#39;ve had to memorize a lot of material. I start with the keyword mnemonic, when that is relatively easy to do, and follow with a lot of spaced retrieval practice to make the association automatic and robust.</p><p> However, I think it&#39;s worth examining the relative efficacy of the two techniques for a few reasons:</p><ul><li> <strong>Many people get overly excited about mnemonics and use them instead of flashcards.</strong> I think this is often ill-advised for the reasons I&#39;ve articulated above.</li><li> <strong>Sometimes the material isn&#39;t mnemonics-friendly.</strong> I found the keyword mnemonic great for learning vocabulary in European languages—but far less helpful for Asian languages. The “sounds like” method doesn&#39;t easily discriminate between words in Chinese (which all sound like each other much more than they sound like words in English) so the first leg in the bridge is weak. However flashcards continued to work and were my primary tool for learning Chinese and Korean vocabulary.</li><li> <strong>For those not trained in mnemonics, it&#39;s worth asking how much time should be invested in acquiring the skills needed.</strong> While mnemonics have some valid use cases, they are often slow and cumbersome without lots of practice, meaning they are best reserved for situations where they&#39;re likely to be used across many memory-intensive subjects.</li></ul><p> In short, if you are proficient with mnemonics, by all means, use them to supplement your flashcards.

An exploration of the logic of learn-or-delegate decisions.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> One of the few lessons I recall from business school is the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/make-or-buy-decision.asp">make-or-buy decision</a> . Big companies often face a choice: should they make something in-house, or outsource it to a supplier?</p><p> The decision depends on many factors, but a big part is cost: will it be cheaper or more reliable if you invest in in-house production? Or does it make more sense to pay someone else to do it?</p><p> Decisions about whether or not to learn something are often similar. For almost any conceivable skill you can:</p><ol><li> Learn to do it yourself.</li><li> Hire someone else to do it.</li><li> Avoid doing it entirely.</li></ol><p> Consider programming. You could learn to write code, hire a programmer to do it for you, or choose work and projects that don&#39;t require you to create software.</p><p> Or language learning. You could learn to speak Mandarin, hire a translator, or avoid doing business with monolingual Mandarin speakers.</p><p> The same choice applies to countless other skills, from understanding the tax code to applying medical advice, repairing drywall or planting a garden. You can learn, outsource or avoid.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Learning Rarely Makes Sense Short-Term</h2><p> One common feature of this problem is that the costs of learning rarely make sense if you&#39;re only thinking about immediate benefits. Even if you&#39;re the smartest person on earth, hiring a Mandarin translator, Java programmer or car mechanic to deal with your problem still takes less time and energy than learning to solve it yourself from scratch.</p><p> Yet, if you already know how to solve a problem, doing it yourself is often (but not always) the most effective option. Hiring people takes time, increases the possibility they won&#39;t understand or be able to deliver what you want and can be more expensive.</p><p> Viewed this way, the optimal point for many learn-or-delegate decisions depends on your prior expertise: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15173" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> This analysis suggests you should do what you&#39;re good at, and delegate what you&#39;re not.</p><p> The major wrinkle in this approach is that <em>your level of expertise isn&#39;t constant</em> . It varies depending on the amount of practice you&#39;ve had on the problem. One of the most famous empirical results is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law_of_practice">power law of practice</a> , suggesting that many aspects of proficiency follow a roughly power-law relationship with the amount of practice.</p><p> The answer to the learn-or-delegate decision doesn&#39;t depend only on your current level of expertise, but also on how often you expect to perform the skill. If you&#39;re currently below the competency threshold where doing it yourself makes sense but will probably use the skill a lot, the total lifetime cost of learning may end up being less than delegating: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15174" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/When-is-Learning-Worth-the-Effort2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> While I&#39;m using an economic lens here, the reasoning still applies outside your job. How much I enjoy painting as a hobby depends on how good I feel I am at it. Thus there&#39;s often an implicit learn-or-ignore decision with recreational activities that follows the same trade-off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Do We Underinvest in Learning?</h2><p> To summarize, many decisions about learning have the following features:</p><ul><li> Doing it yourself doesn&#39;t initially pass a cost-benefit test.</li><li> The more you practice, the lower the cost becomes.</li><li> Thus whether it&#39;s “worth it” to learn something depends on a far-sighted calculation of how much you&#39;ll need to use the skill.</li></ul><p> Unfortunately our intrinsic motivational system is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/12/14/procrastinate-expert/">remarkably short-term in its focus</a> . Immediate costs or payoffs influence our decision far more than long-term ones. Experiments show people often pay steep discount rates for delayed rewards, in <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-02">ways that are inconsistent</a> with any rational agent (even an extremely impulsive one).</p><p> This suggests we may be underinvesting in learning. We&#39;re disinclined to practice skills that fail an initial cost-benefit analysis—even if our investment of practice would be profitable over the course of our lifetime.</p><p> This insight helped Vat and me while learning other languages. The costs of practicing a language are relatively high when you&#39;re not consistently using it. In the short term, forcing yourself to interact in a new language is also costly. But, if you practice enough, speaking the language of the country you&#39;re visiting becomes easier than sticking entirely within an English bubble. Adults are resourceful and frequently find ways to avoid using an unfamiliar language; the consequence is that few get anything close to the levels of exposure that young children can&#39;t help but get when learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Matthew Effects in Learning</h2><p> Another consequence of this basic model is that we should expect Matthew Effects in learning.</p><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">The Matthew Effect</a> was first coined by sociologists Robert Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in their study of elite scientists. Eminent scientists often get more credit than unknown researchers for similar work, meaning that, over time, eminence tends to compound while less famous academics linger in obscurity.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15172' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15172' title="The name of the effect comes from the parable of the talents in the Gospel of Matthew, &amp;#8220;For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.&amp;#8221;"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Later, psychologist Keith Stanovich applied <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">the same insight to reading</a> . Those with a slight advantage in early reading ability had a slightly reduced cost of reading new material. This lead to them practicing more, further reducing the costs of reading. Given the connection between reading and other forms of learning, he even hypothesized that early reading ability might bootstrap intelligence by making it easier to acquire new skills and knowledge.</p><p> Research bears out Stanovich&#39;s hypothesis. In <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12272">a study looking at identical twins</a> who varied in early reading ability, the slightly more proficient twin later showed gains in intelligence compared with their genetically-identical sibling. Skills beget skills; knowledge begets knowledge.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Specialization and Focusing on Strengths</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s helpful to clarify. I&#39;m not suggesting that since learned skills get easier with practice, we should do everything for ourselves and never delegate.</p><p> This is false, even by the basic logic I&#39;ve spelled out above. Some tasks simply aren&#39;t encountered frequently enough to cross the cost/benefit threshold. I may never have an opportunity to speak Mongolian, so if I ever meet a monolingual Mongolian speaker, I&#39;d be happy to lean on Google Translate.</p><p> Additionally, we can&#39;t consider skills in isolation. Spending time learning one thing is an implicit decision not to learn something else. I could learn French, but that time is taken away from learning Mandarin. I could learn Javascript, but that time can&#39;t also be spent learning Python.</p><p> Ultimately, specialization, not self-sufficiency, is the road to abundance in the world we live in today. We delegate the vast majority of skills in our lives, not because learning them all is impossible, but because getting really good at one thing makes sense when it&#39;s relatively easy to delegate everything else.</p><p> Despite spending years learning programming, I do virtually none of it for my own business. Given that my writing is central to my business, and I don&#39;t have enough time to do all the writing I&#39;d like, hiring other people to do the programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">makes more sense</a> . Those people, in turn, tend to be much further along the expertise curve than I am because they&#39;ve made a similar decision to specialize.</p><p> That being said, there are many instances where skills can&#39;t easily be delegated. I might be able to hire out behind-the-scenes programming for my website, but it doesn&#39;t save effort or cost to hire someone to read the research used to write the articles. If I don&#39;t understand the research, I can&#39;t weave it into the text I&#39;m producing.</p><p> In other cases, delegation is an imperfect or inconvenient substitute for being able to do something yourself. Relying on a translator is not equivalent to being able to speak the language yourself when you move to another country. Being able to read a text isn&#39;t made redundant if someone narrates it to you aloud. Thus being able to speak the language of the country you live in and being able to read are skills that are almost certainly worth mastering.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Thinking about Learning in the Long-Term</h2><p> I find it useful to keep in mind a few things when I face resistance to learning something new:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. How much can I expect this skill to get easier with more practice?</h3><p> One way to estimate this is to look at people with varying degrees of experience. How much effort did it take them to do what you struggle with? The learning curve is quite steep for some skills—you get good relatively quickly. For others, the curve is flat for a long time—you may need to practice for years before you feel it&#39;s worth the effort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. How much would I use the skill if I was better at it?</h3><p> Supposing you could reach the relatively flat part of the practice curve, how much would you use it?</p><p> If you live in a country that speaks a language you don&#39;t know, learning that language would definitely pass the cost-benefit test. Learning a major world language you might use in work or educational contexts probably also does. A niche language that isn&#39;t spoken much … maybe not? In this case, it may only be worth learning if you have a strong intrinsic motivation to learn it.</p><p> If a skill is central to your career, it may easily be worth the cost, even if it is initially difficult for you to learn. In contrast, a career skill that doesn&#39;t fit well with your existing skills may go unused even if you&#39;re nearly an expert—it&#39;s simply cheaper to outsource.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. How much would I enjoy the skill, conditional on being better at it?</h3><p> Economic rewards aren&#39;t the only motivation. If you&#39;re good at something, you tend to enjoy it more and draw personal satisfaction. But that&#39;s more true of some skills than others. You might be particularly proud of being able to paint a realistic landscape but not feel too special about being able to file your taxes quickly.</p><p> Deciding when it makes sense to learn isn&#39;t trivial, but given that our intuitions often give us a misleadingly short-term picture of what&#39;s possible, it can be helpful to think more deeply about it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15151 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Need to learn something difficult?

Of those that do, they often make mistakes that render the plan highly unrealistic—a recipe for future guilt, not future learning.</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to outline how to make a studying plan—and how you can stick to it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Make a Studying Plan?</h2><p> Learning is effortful. Although that effort can be enjoyable, our impulses about what to do in the moment often don&#39;t coincide with what would maximize learning. Indeed, the research shows that students frequently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">choose activities</a> that feel fun but don&#39;t deliver results.</p><p> A good analogy is exercise. While playing a sport or going for a jog can be fun, our brains are designed to avoid unnecessary physical exertion. That&#39;s why you rarely see anyone over the age of ten running down the street unless they&#39;re late for an appointment.</p><p> If you want to develop fitness without injuring yourself, it helps to have a workout plan you can and will stick to, rather than just going to the gym whenever you feel like and working on whatever equipment you stumble into.</p><p> The logic is the same for studying. Having a plan maximizes the chance of investing effort where it counts to create learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step One: Review Your Materials </h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already chosen some class, book, tutorials or other curriculum to guide you. (If you haven&#39;t, the first step is to do your research and find a good resource for the skill you&#39;re trying to learn!)</p><p> The starting point is to review your curriculum and figure out:</p><ul><li> What are the lessons you&#39;ll need to watch/read/review?</li><li> What are the practice activities you need to engage in?</li><li> What are the required deliverables (essays/homework) you need to complete?</li><li> How will you need to use the skills and knowledge you&#39;ve gained? Consider things like the format of the final exam as well as where you plan to apply the skills and knowledge you&#39;re learning.</li></ul><p> A pure practice project may be an exception. In this kind of project, you&#39;re not working off materials but trying to practice or implement knowledge you&#39;ve gained elsewhere. For a practice project, you&#39;re creating your own curriculum, so you can choose your own pace. These tend to be more successful when you&#39;ve gone beyond the beginner period and can more successfully guide your own practice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Two: Calculate Your Minimum Time Investment</h2><p> The minimum time investment includes all the work you must put in to complete the class as specified. This includes:</p><ul><li> How long will it take to do the required readings?</li><li> How long will it take to watch any videos/lectures/lessons?</li><li> How long will it take to finish the required deliverables (homework, essays, projects)?</li></ul><p> Videos and recorded lectures are easy to estimate: you can add up the run time of all the videos. Will you be able to <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">watch at an accelerated pace</a> ? If so, you can divide the total by the estimated playback rate (eg, 1.5 or 2 times speed). Otherwise, this time is a fixed amount based on how long the lessons are.</p><p> For required readings, you need an estimate of your reading rate. You can get a first approximation by timing yourself reading a few pages and extrapolating that to the whole book. Read slowly and deliberately; the speed for long reading sessions is inevitably slower than a few-minute sprint.</p><p> Homework is hard to estimate in advance, but you may be able to get an estimate from the course provider, teacher or past students.</p><p> The general idea here is to calculate the minimum time investment to work through the materials you&#39;ve been provided—without any additional studying.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Three: Estimate Additional Studying Time Needs</h2><p> For some classes, simply doing all the work assigned will allow you to pass the test and apply it in real life. But for most classes, you&#39;ll have to go beyond this.</p><p> Some additional places you might expect to invest time are:</p><ul><li> Extra practice questions/homework.</li><li> Application to real-life problems and contexts.</li><li> Creating/reviewing flashcards.</li><li> Self-explanations, such as the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">Feynman Technique</a> .</li><li> Extra research not mentioned in the syllabus.</li></ul><p> A good way to estimate this is by looking at your personal historical data: how much time have you typically needed to invest, beyond the minimum curriculum, to achieve the results you want from the class? There&#39;s no “correct” answer here. Some classes are time-intensive, and the required material is challenging to get through. Other classes are sparse and leave it to students to master the material on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Four: Schedule Studying in Your Calendar</h2><p> Once you have an itemized list of your expected time investment, you need to figure out when you&#39;re actually going to do everything.</p><p> Put any due dates, exams, live lectures or lessons directly in your calendar. For reading, working on homework, practice efforts and other forms of studying, you should still allocate time for them, but there are two different ways to do it:</p><ul><li> <strong>The most rigorous option is to schedule everything as an appointment.</strong> I recommend this approach if studying has to fit inside an already crowded schedule. So if you&#39;re a busy parent and professional studying for a licensing exam, you&#39;d better put studying time directly in your calendar, or it will get pushed to the side in the moment.</li><li> <strong>The more flexible option is to create a weekly or daily routine.</strong> The exact activities in each block would vary depending on your goals, but the time commitments themselves would be relatively routine. For instance, you might decide to study every morning before work, or in the evenings, or on weekends.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Five: Sanity Check</h2><p> At this point in the process, we can do a basic sanity check: how does your calculated time investment from Step Two and Step Three compare with the time you&#39;ve scheduled?   If your available time for the project is less than the estimated minimum, you&#39;ve already got a non-starter. You need to clear more time in your schedule, rethink the aims of the learning project, or expand the timeline you are allowing to complete it.</p><p> If your available time is slightly over what you&#39;ve budgeted, you have little room for error. Getting sick, an unexpectedly challenging topic or a surprise interruption could derail the whole project.</p><p> If you have substantially more time available than you&#39;ve budgeted, that&#39;s not necessarily a sign to relax. With too much slack, you might not feel the pressure to study when you need to and end up wasting time procrastinating. In those cases, I recommend setting soft deadlines that push the work ahead of the more relaxed schedule. This approach can keep the pressure comfortable but challenging, so you have more room for error later.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Six: Getting Feedback</h2><p> Making a plan is the easy part. The hard part is sticking to it. Fortunately, if you keep an eye on the feedback you&#39;re getting while you&#39;re studying and adjust accordingly, the plan you make can be an invaluable guide rather than something that gets tossed aside at the first brush with difficulty.</p><p> Consider these sources of feedback:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Feedback on sticking to your schedule.</h3><p> The first source of feedback is your ability to implement the plan. A helpful strategy is simply to write your intention on an agenda or planner each day and then record what you actually did. For example, you might have intended to study for three hours on Wednesday, but you were interrupted and only got in two hours.</p><p> Whenever there are deviations from your plan, it&#39;s helpful to note the source of the obstacle. Even though you can&#39;t control everything that deflects you from your plan, few obstacles are insurmountable if you can recognize them. Consider:</p><ul><li> <strong>Deviations due to interruptions from others.</strong> Communicate boundaries for your studying time so others appreciate its importance. If you can&#39;t avoid interruptions, find fall-back studying slots in your schedule to make up for occasional, unavoidable interruptions.</li><li> <strong>Deviations from lack of preparation.</strong> Your computer died. You couldn&#39;t log into your account to access the lesson. You had to buy colored pencils. Find a way to do these things before your scheduled session or eliminate them as unnecessary.</li><li> <strong>Deviations because of procrastination/motivation.</strong> Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> , lower your expectations for proficiency in the session to avoid perfectionism, or alternate between reading/practice to avoid mind wandering or boredom.</li></ul><p> Learning is effortful and genuine obstacles can arise, making it hard to stick to one&#39;s plan. However, if you can identify what is causing the interruptions, you can find remedies in many cases.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Feedback on your learning progress.</h3><p> The second source of feedback concerns your progress in learning. Sometimes skills and subjects gel instantly, and you don&#39;t need to review them. In other cases, the new material can seem bewildering and exceed your estimates of how long it will take to master.</p><p> Once again, the key is to observe the feedback and break it down:</p><ul><li> <strong>Are you struggling because the basics aren&#39;t firmly entrenched?</strong> Drills, flashcards and repeated practice on simple problems can help fix this.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you don&#39;t understand a difficult idea?</strong> Self-explanations, talking to teachers/peers/tutors and finding alternative explanatory sources can be helpful.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing wrong or how to improve it?</strong> Seeking coaching, corrective feedback or guidance may be helpful.</li></ul><p> The more granular you can be in identifying your problems, the easier they are to resolve. Zooming in on particular concepts, movements, facts or procedures is the key to getting past difficulties.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Seven: Making Modifications</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve gotten some feedback, you may need to modify your plan. That might involve increasing the hours you invest if you&#39;re falling behind, or you might change your routine so that you can actually invest the hours you said you would.</p><p> In the end, you may not stick to your plan with total rigidity. The primary benefit of planning isn&#39;t to eliminate all improvisation and flexibility. Rather it&#39;s to marshal the resources of time and energy needed to learn and identify obstacles ahead of time so you can avoid most of them. What&#39;s ultimately useful is less the plan itself, but the thinking that goes into creating it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/">Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 16 May 2023 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15136 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Why do people sometimes abruptly become a better version of themselves?

He wanted to understand why this happens and ask how someone might attempt a similar transformation.</p><p> I&#39;ve witnessed this kind of personality change in others several times, so I believe the phenomenon is real. A number of my friends suddenly became much more motivated, conscientious, organized and ambitious—often translating into better life outcomes for themselves.</p><p> It&#39;s also something I&#39;ve personally experienced. When I was around fifteen, I changed my diet, started waking up early, exercising regularly, reading books and trying various ways to be more productive. While the transition took place over a couple of years rather than a singular moment, it still a rather abrupt directional change in my personality that has culminated in who I am today. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p> Assuming, for a second, that my introspective self-report and anecdotal observations are accurate, I think the reader&#39;s question is important and merits further discussion. Why do people sometimes abruptly become better versions of themselves? Perhaps more importantly, why does it so often seem to fail?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Discovering Self-Actualization</h2><p> For lack of a better term, I&#39;ll call this kind of transformation discovering self-actualization. That sounds vague, but it&#39;s the best way I can describe the experience. If you&#39;re allergic to self-help jargon, perhaps another way of describing it might be “becoming an adult” or “getting your act together.” </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> In my case, I think the changes were triggered by a fundamental restructuring of my belief system. Namely, I began to believe that there is considerable room for autonomy in making decisions over my life and that, if I chose wisely, those decisions could make a big difference in where my life ended up.</p><p> Wanting to start my own business was also a significant trigger. Something about the intrinsic appeal of being my own boss and having complete financial independence, combined with the inherent difficulty in succeeding in that goal, acted as a catalyst. Indeed, I&#39;ve known quite a few people who have discovered self-actualization in the context of professional ambition.</p><p> For other people, the trigger was something more concrete. They read a particular book that changed their worldview ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> , for many). They encountered a new-to-them religion, philosophy or spiritual practice ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a> seems to be another common trigger for change).</p><p> Even if the exact cause is idiosyncratic, I see a few common features:</p><ul><li> <strong>A belief that there are lives better than the one we are currently living.</strong> The central premise is that there&#39;s a broad array of possible futures, and many of them are better than the default. This seems to hold even in philosophical views that reject most kinds of ambition. For instance, those interested in mindfulness meditation often spurn the idea that career ambitions should be made central to life. But they still believe that mindfulness will let them experience a better quality of life.</li><li> <strong>A sudden, pervasive increase in self-efficacy.</strong> While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura&#39;s original concept</a> was decidedly granular, there do appear to be moments where you become more confident in succeeding at a broader range of actions.</li><li> <strong>Increased valuation of delaying gratification and resisting impulses.</strong> The willingness to work hard, do things that make you feel uncomfortable and resist your immediate habits and impulses is also at work. Over a relatively short period, someone who might have struggled with sticking to an exercise program is suddenly taking on dozens of high-effort challenges.</li><li> <strong>(Over)zealous application of the above changes.</strong> Often, people who experience a major paradigm shift are overly optimistic about the value of alternate versions of their life, overly confident about their ability to execute, and overly focused on self-improvement over momentary gratification.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Skeptic&#39;s Critique</h2><p> Of course, I&#39;m far from the first to notice this phenomenon. A lot of self-help gurus have built their entire marketing empires around selling people transformative life change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">Tony Robbins</a> , in particular, seems to make a big deal about these kinds of moments.</p><p> The skeptic would argue that these kinds of changes don&#39;t typically last. Hype fades, and while getting excited about something is easy, we rarely change our personality or behavior permanently.</p><p> I tend to agree with the skeptic—most of the time. I suspect that most people experience one or, maybe, two of these shifts in their entire life. Many people may never experience it. Change, instead, is generally gradual and directionless. Sometimes we get in a bit better shape, sometimes we let ourselves go. Most bursts of self-improvement revert to the mean.</p><p> However, given the significance of these dramatic shifts, we shouldn&#39;t round their probability to zero. Experiencing such a moment once or twice in your life might make up for dozens of other fizzled attempts at bettering yourself.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Does it Happen? Why Does it Fail?</h2><p> My speculative theory of these kinds of personal transformations is:</p><ul><li> <strong>There&#39;s a temporary change in your optimism, confidence and valuing of effort.</strong> This kind of momentary effect can come from reading a self-help book, having a role model who inspires you to work at something, or having a private epiphany.</li><li> <strong>The environment creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.</strong> The easiest way to see this kind of positive feedback loop would be setting a goal, achieving it, and suddenly biasing your other estimates of self-efficacy or confidence upward.</li><li> <strong>Once the initial feedback loop wears off, you&#39;re already in a sufficiently “different” position for your life.</strong> Your habits and material circumstances of personal identity have shifted to a new equilibrium position, and you now maintain it.</li></ul><p> Under this theory, most self-improvement efforts fizzle because the momentary burst of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, and the equilibrium you reach is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">metastable</a> . Eventually you decay back to the person you were before because a lot of gravity is pulling you back that way.</p><p> Even when this kind of transformative change occurs, I think there are probably limits on how far it can go. People&#39;s <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">beliefs about their malleability</a> vary wildly around the actual figure. Some people suddenly become incredibly optimistic about their ability to become popular, successful, smart, enlightened, etc., as well as the converse, where people adopt a fixed view of themselves and believe change is impossible.</p><p> The transformations I&#39;ve witnessed in other people tend to involve modestly unrealistic beliefs. This raises an interesting question of whether some amount of self-delusion helps in crossing over into a new equilibrium, even if it&#39;s unsustainable. Were that true, though much-maligned by skeptics, this small break from reality may actually be key—a truly sober assessment of one&#39;s possibilities may not encourage enough of a transitory change in your beliefs to shift over to a new equilibrium.</p><p> At the same time, it also seems clear that most changes are not of this magnitude. Discovering that you can take charge of your life is probably something you can only really do once or twice in your life. Once that&#39;s firmly established in your beliefs, further adjustments are probably minor in comparison—tweaks to your habits, skills or perspective.</p><p> Since the world is flush with people pitching and persuading others to adopt a self-actualization belief set (even if it is partly delusional), a related question is why such transformations are relatively rare. My suspicion is that they&#39;re harder to sustain because while it&#39;s easy to find sources of inspiration, it&#39;s much harder to locate the positive feedback loops that keep the motivation going.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Can You Trigger a Change in Yourself?</h2><p> Given that many of us would like to have a sudden, positive shift in the direction of our lives, is there anything we can do to facilitate this kind of transition? </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。 While I&#39;ve witnessed it many times, the change itself happens as a by-product of something else rather than the person actively seeking it out.</p><p> However, I do think there are a few generic ingredients that may increase the likelihood of such a change:</p><ul><li> <strong>Success with self-set ambitions.</strong> Self-efficacy seems to be a crucial motivational component here. It&#39;s not enough to know that building a business, learning a language or getting in shape is possible. You have to believe <em>you</em> could do it. While achieving one thing doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to across-the-board motivation, having more success is likely to encourage increased self-efficacy.</li><li> <strong>Reading a lot of books with inspiring-but-credible messages.</strong> If modest self-delusion plays a role in initiating these transitions, the temporary boost you get from reading motivational material may increase your chances of hitting an inflection point. But inspiration fails if you don&#39;t believe it. Hence, finding optimistic sources that seem credible to you is more important than just picking the cheesiest self-help title.</li><li> <strong>Finding challenging, worthwhile goals.</strong> At least in my own case, I felt like the desire to start a business was a catalyst. The combination of an attractive goal and knowing I wouldn&#39;t succeed unless I worked really hard seemed vital.</li><li> <strong>More randomness.</strong> A final catalyst is having experiences that take you outside your comfort zone. The idea here is that greater variability in your day-to-day experience increases the likelihood of stumbling upon a positive feedback loop that alters your course in life.</li></ul><p> In the end, I&#39;m not entirely sure why some people become obsessed with personal productivity, mindfulness meditation, exercising daily, building a business or becoming a straight-A student. I don&#39;t know why the direction of their life seems to pivot abruptly after a particular experience. But I agree with the reader who emailed me that even if such transitions are rare, they seem important and poorly understood.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/">Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 04:41:23 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15111 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> My pick for the best ten books on learning how to learn better!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/">Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What are the best books to read to become a better learner?

Ashman, a disciple of Sweller&#39;s, has written a powerful book explaining why cognitive load is central to learning how to learn.</p><p> Although the primary audience for this book is teachers, I found it very interesting as a learner. While Ashman&#39;s advice—that teachers should fully and thoroughly teach their subjects—don&#39;t sound surprising, it&#39;s an important message because of the alternative theories it rejects. This book is a must-read if you&#39;ve ever struggled with teaching or learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise/dp/0544947223">Peak</a> by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise/dp/0544947223"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-680x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15122" width="150" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-768x1156.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL-1360x2048.jpg 1360w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/61cc4suOpAL.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></figure></div><p> Anders Ericsson&#39;s work is perhaps best known from Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2EEKKWJ7I6H76&amp;keywords=outliers&amp;qid=1683819481&amp;sprefix=outliers%2Caps%2C157&amp;sr=8-1">Outliers</a> , or Geoffrey Colvin&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3UDNNFOGARFER&amp;keywords=talent+is+overrated&amp;qid=1683819492&amp;sprefix=talent+is+overrate%2Caps%2C162&amp;sr=8-1">Talent is Overrated</a> .

Today, I&#39;m rounding up some of those suggestions and trying to synthesize the advice for when (and when not) to use these tools for learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs</h2><p> Using applications like ChatGPT requires some care.</p><p> Part of the difficulty is that ChatGPT&#39;s human-like conversation abilities can be deceptive. Feeling like you&#39;re talking to a real person encourages you to rely on conversational expectations that may not hold with a machine.</p><p> For instance, we generally expect that most people do not make up facts. Large language models, however, routinely violate this expectation by providing fluent answers that may be totally wrong. The metacognitive ability to know what you don&#39;t know is underdeveloped in these applications.</p><p> Another expectation we have is that verbal fluency tracks other aspects of intelligence. We expect that someone who can spout lines from Shakespeare, explain quantum computing, and give a proof of the prime number theorem in rhyming verse would also be able to count. Thus, naively treating LLMs like a really smart and knowledgeable person is likely to backfire.</p><p> Those caveats aside, ChatGPT is clearly helpful for a range of tasks. Simon Willison suggests thinking of LLMs as a “ <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/">calculator for words</a> ”—something that can do useful things with text—rather than as a general-purpose intelligence or smart person.</p><p> I tend to agree. The more we can distinguish the cases where LLMs work well from where they don&#39;t (yet), the more we&#39;ll be able to take advantage of the new capabilities without falling into unexpected traps.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Ten Useful Learning Strategies with ChatGPT</h2><p> After receiving dozens of emails from my audience on how they have been personally using ChatGPT to learn, I&#39;ve compiled some tips with some of the most common suggestions.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Create your own Socratic tutor.</h3><p> By far, the most common use readers reported was using an LLM as a personal tutor.</p><p> Asking ChatGPT to explain tricky concepts, unfamiliar code or problems seems like an area where LLMs might do alright. And the only reasonable substitute (a human expert) is notoriously expensive and in short supply.</p><p> If you do this in conjunction with a class or textbook, the risks of mistakes also seem attenuated since you still have a primary source to compare against. Challenge explanations that don&#39;t jive with what you&#39;ve read in the book rather than taking everything the AI says at face value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Practice chatting in new languages.</h3><p> The next most common way people used LLMs to learn better was as a language tutor. This seems like a task LLMs are well-equipped for. Whatever their other flaws, they can produce grammatically correct text.</p><p> Many people set up their conversations with ChatGPT so that the AI could go back and forth between the language they are learning and English explanations when they got confused. Likely, those explanations may be imperfect, but human tutors also often give incorrect accounts of the grammar and vocabulary they manage to use proficiently.</p><p> Another use is rewriting texts to be at a more beginner-friendly level of reading comprehension. Graded readers and comprehensive input are great strategies for learning to read in another language. Unfortunately, learner materials are often sparse or uninteresting. You can use an LLM to transform a text you want to read that is written at a fluent native level into something appropriate for your current ability.</p><p> Duolingo seems to be getting in on the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">LLM game as well</a> . I&#39;ve been harsh on the drag-and-drop style of language learning used in earlier versions, but these new advances may force me to revise my opinion.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Generate summaries of longer texts.</h3><p> Summaries are another area where LLMs seem to excel. Consumer applications already exist for <a href="https://consensus.app/">generating summaries</a> of journal articles or research topics.</p><p> Several readers said they were using these AI tools to provide digests of their substantial reading material, helping them keep atop new developments in their field.</p><p> Good summaries, especially those fine-tuned to your particular needs, might be a good way of navigating the large information loads we often face in knowledge work. You could use it to help prioritize which documents to read in-depth or do a first pass organizing unfamiliar material. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15095" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-768x366.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1536x732.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary.jpg 1619w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> It looks like ChatGPT is not able to open links to summarize directly, but it often does a reasonable job hallucinating with famous texts like the one I used above. Until this functionality is standard in the consumer application, it&#39;s better to copy+paste.</p></blockquote><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Dialog with long documents.</h3><p> LLMs also can help you “ask questions” of longer texts. For instance, when reading a scientific paper you could quickly query the sample size or ask for the methodology or results. <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a> does this while offering references, so the risk of mistakes seems reduced when you can easily double-check the LLM&#39;s work.</p><p> While there are more fanciful usages here, such as people asking ChatGPT to impersonate a given writer and dialog with them, I suspect the ability to ask natural-language questions of documents and receive replies with references is a useful tool for dealing with large texts.</p><p> That said, you must be prepared to fact-check the LLM&#39;s answers. For instance, in the dialog captured below, I asked ChatGPT to list evidence supporting strongly-guided instruction, and it cited a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.59.1.14">review article by Mayer</a> . But it falsely claimed Mayer&#39;s work was a meta-analysis, which it isn&#39;t. In fact, the paper isn&#39;t even a comprehensive literature review but simply looks at three prominent cases of the failure of discovery learning. If taken at face value, this response can potentially mislead, but it&#39;s relatively easy to “check” the AI&#39;s work if you know what text it is transforming. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="745" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15096" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1536x1118.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog.jpg 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. Rewrite texts at different levels of explanatory depth.</h3><p> A major difficulty in following expert thinking is that most expert-level text is written for other experts. Concepts are unexplained, context is lacking and jargon abounds. This means that most people must rely on translators, such as general-market nonfiction or science writers, who present what experts think in a more readable format.</p><p> There seem to be two approaches to using AI tools here. One is simply asking an LLM to explain a popular concept in simpler terms, such as: “Explain quantum computing like I&#39;m an eighth-grader.” The other is to provide ChatGPT with a text or explanation and ask the AI to rewrite it in a more digestible manner.</p><p> I tend to think the latter is a little more reliable since you have the source material to compare with rather than taking ChatGPT&#39;s word for it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. Clear up unfamiliar jargon.</h3><p> Several years ago, I remember reading Tyler Cowen&#39;s <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution blog</a> and being perplexed by his frequent, unexplained use of the term “Straussian” to describe ideas or other thinkers. I Googled for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.</p><p> After a lot of research, I understood the term as meaning, roughly, “closely reading between the lines in prominent thinkers&#39; ideas, looking for what they really meant but couldn&#39;t always express because of prevailing censorship and intellectual orthodoxy.”</p><p> Had ChatGPT existed during my confusion, I could have just gotten this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="422" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15097" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x124.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x316.png 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1536x632.png 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> Many readers found similar benefits in using LLMs to figure out jargon and terms used within a particular community in a way that dictionary definitions often fail to elucidate.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Create study plans and agendas.</h3><p> This usage surprised me, but it showed up enough times among reader replies that I include it here. People seem to like using AI to tell them how and when to learn.</p><p> For instance, some readers asked ChatGPT to break down a complex learning goal and give them a curriculum. Others preferred to go even further, asking for ChatGPT to create a studying schedule for them, given their constraints for the day.</p><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t trust LLMs to give me a well-designed curriculum for a subject. But if I was learning something completely new, it might be a decent starting point. Sometimes the hardest part of approaching a new field is breaking down what appears to be an insurmountable goal. Similarly, sometimes being told when to study can help overcome the inertia of getting started.</p><p> While skill breakdowns might be alright, ChatGPT still struggles with creating reading lists, confabulating books and references. Thus, while it might do well for decomposing an ambiguous learning task, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to give me good resources (yet).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. Provide refreshers on forgotten or infrequently used tools.</h3><p> Programmers were the biggest professional group to reply to my query. I can&#39;t say whether this is because programming is uniquely well-suited to LLMs or because programmers, as a group, are more likely to adopt novel software tools.</p><p> The productivity advantages for programmers seem obvious. I don&#39;t write much code these days, so I haven&#39;t made much use of this well-publicized feature of LLMs. But since a lot of coding is relatively routine, the ability to have a machine create the first draft for an algorithm clearly saves a lot of time.</p><p> While there are cases of people with zero programming knowledge relying on AI output to build applications, I suspect these might be tricky to debug and maintain. In contrast, an expert programmer can override ChatGPT&#39;s output for a language he or she knows particularly well.</p><p> The place LLMs seem to work really well is at the fringes of a programmer&#39;s expertise. Many programmers told me that they found AI helpful in getting starting hints in unfamiliar languages or tools. Their base of programming experience allowed them to make sense of and implement the output, but their unfamiliarity with the underlying language meant the AI saved them a lot of time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. Generate flashcards based on text. (Tentative)</h3><p> Flashcards are a powerful learning tool. They&#39;re also a pain in the butt to make.</p><p> Some readers said they were using ChatGPT to generate flashcards for subjects they&#39;re studying. This seems well within the LLM abilities as a “calculator for words.” Thus, with the correct prompts, you could get fairly good results here—provided you&#39;re inputting the material you wish to see transformed into flashcards and not expecting the LLM to get the facts on its own (see below).</p><p> However, given the difficulty of making “good” flashcards, I wouldn&#39;t enter any into my Anki without reviewing them first. Nonetheless, making flashcards is tedious, so getting a first draft that I later review might speed up the process considerably. The risks seem relatively limited if you confirm the cards&#39; correctness before putting them in your deck.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. Use it to organize your notes. (Advanced)</h3><p> As someone who does a lot of research, I often waste a lot of time trying to locate my notes. Robert Martin finds the same problem. Searching via keywords is fraught because sometimes you can&#39;t remember the exact term you used, even if the meaning is roughly the same.</p><p> Martin <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2023/02/05/gpt-for-second-brain/">solves this problem</a> by using the embedding feature of LLMs. While not strictly ChatGPT, this tool from the same family of natural language processing techniques allows you to find semantically-related notes rather than exact keyword matches.</p><p> Personalized LLMs that live on your hard drive and access your existing data may be a valuable application. I&#39;d love to be able to search things I know I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t quite recall where.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Things NOT To Do</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Don&#39;t expect AI to get facts right.</h3><p> LLMs frequently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">make stuff up</a> . These hallucinations are problematic if you depend on ChatGPT to give correct answers. The prevalence of these mistakes is difficult to say right now. When Wikipedia was released, for instance, “experts” were in an uproar about how the user-generated nature of the website meant it couldn&#39;t ever be relied upon as a source. Except Wikipedia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438900a">actually does fairly well</a> , and some of these knee-jerk reactions were misplaced.</p><p> LLMs haven&#39;t reached Wikipedia&#39;s quality in terms of facts, and we still don&#39;t know much about when they&#39;re likely to get an answer right and when they&#39;re likely to make stuff up. For now, it seems best to use them for situations where the cost of an incorrect answer is minimal, either because you can look it up in a verified source, or because your use of the AI for isn&#39;t factual in nature.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Don&#39;t expect AI to get citations right.</h3><p> While LLMs sometimes mess up facts, they seem abysmal at getting citations right. They frequently invent authors, papers, studies and research.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t use a LLM for any research that I needed to cite, and I would always double-check the sources it does provide.</p><p> Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t ask an LLM to give me a reading list or references to specific books or authors (unless, possibly, the authors were quite famous and likely to be well-represented in the data set).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Don&#39;t expect AI to get the math right.</h3><p> I believe it&#39;s a mistake to attribute general intelligence to LLMs based on their ability to do many tasks at a human level or beyond. As with chess bots and image classifiers, the technology behind LLMs is extremely narrow compared to what we would expect of a human who scored similarly on verbal tests.</p><p> One finding from psychology is that much of reasoning is performed by different subsystems in the brain than those devoted to language. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">This paper</a> argues that LLMs seem to match the neurological evidence from double-dissociation studies: you can have fluent verbal abilities with seriously impaired reasoning and vice versa.</p><p> As such, LLMs are really bad at math. And not just higher-level math that humans struggle with. LLMs often fail at <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt">basic counting tasks</a> . Thus I suspect LLMs would be uniquely bad at a task like providing practice problems for a math class and grading the answers. ChatGPT might be able to explain a math concept well, but be unreliable at actually using it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Have you used ChatGPT or other AI tools to further your learning?

However, before I share that post, I&#39;d like to address a different question.</p><p> One question a few readers have is whether ChatGPT will eliminate the need to learn things. After all, if you can easily ask the machine a question and it will spit out an expert-like answer, what&#39;s the point of getting students to write essays, memorize facts or try to remember a lot of knowledge?</p><p> Like everyone, I&#39;m gobsmacked by the performance of large language models like ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. That said, it&#39;s hard to predict things, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">especially about the future</a> . And I suspect the evolution of new AI tools is harder to predict than most things. We have poor intuitions about what sorts of problems machines can solve, and so the general discourse around AI as a field tends to swing between wild pessimism and optimism as we learn more about the path ahead.</p><p> One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won&#39;t make learning obsolete.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Learning Still Matters</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1521622480&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> One reason I can feel confident about the continued value of learning is that while ChatGPT is novel, the kind of technological change it has brought about is not.</p><p> Humans have been inventing technology that has replaced aspects of cognitive work for thousands of years. In every case, the result of that substitution was not a diminishing of the need for skills and knowledge—but an increase.</p><p> Consider the impact of writing. Human knowledge used to be transmitted orally. When writing became available, thinkers such as Socrates decried the damage it would do to people&#39;s memory. We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down.</p><p> Or consider calculators, which have been widespread for decades. You probably have one on your smartphone. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p><p> A robust finding in educational psychology is the importance of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Why-Knowledge-Matters-Rescuing-Educational/dp/1612509525/ref=asc_df_1612509525/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=296035595995&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17947244405290068344&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001551&amp;hvtargid=pla-464465047333&amp;psc=1">background knowledge</a> . People who know more about a subject can understand and retain more of what they read. Knowledge outside your head doesn&#39;t count, since it can&#39;t participate in learning and reasoning.</p><p> Similarly, even if you use a calculator all the time, you understand math better when you first learn to do it by hand. Working through low-level calculations creates conceptual and procedural skills that build an intuitive sense for the underlying algorithms. While you can save effort by using a calculator, the intuition you gained from your initial learning helps you recognize if the calculation is correct and how to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p> The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Will ChatGPT Change What Knowledge Matters?</h2><p> So perhaps we can safely reject the extreme position that learning will become obsolete. Won&#39;t LLMs change what <em>kind</em> of knowledge is worth learning?</p><p> This is probably the case. But it&#39;s not obvious to me what the transition will be, and I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s intuitions on this are correct either.</p><p> The gut reaction seems to be that since large language models can easily spit out an explanation to any question answerable within the sphere of well-documented human knowledge, LLMs devalue this kind of book learning.</p><p> Even putting aside the hallucinations and failings of current LLMs and assuming engineers perfect the technology to the point where it rarely gets these questions wrong, I&#39;m not sure this intuition is correct.</p><p> As mentioned in the research on background knowledge, your ability to ask a useful question and then understand an LLM&#39;s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess. For instance, economist and polymath Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/what-is-the-single-best-way-of-improving-your-gpt-prompts.html">argues</a> that asking an economics question to ChatGPT goes better if you ask it to answer in the style of Milton Friedman or Paul Krugman. Your own economics knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a new phenomenon. If the answers to all the world&#39;s questions were already on the Internet, but you didn&#39;t know where to look, they&#39;d be invisible to you.</p><p> Contrary to the supposition that book learning will be less relevant, I suspect that it will be <em>more</em> important. The people who get the most programming help from ChatGPT are existing programmers—since their knowledge allows them to ask well-formulated programming questions and accurately assess the results. LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Subjects/Skills are Still Worth Learning?</h2><p> A few people wrote to me wondering whether it even makes sense to learn second languages, programming, creative writing or art, given the ever-increasing powers of these applications.</p><p> My feeling is that, on the whole, the value of these skills hasn&#39;t changed much. What will probably change is the differential value of mastery versus novice levels of various skills. There may be fewer professional opportunities available for mediocre programmers, writers, artists or translators. This kind of skill polarization has been going on for a long time, as I documented in my book <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . ChatGPT is just a continuation of current trends.</p><p> But just as there&#39;s a diminished value for someone who can crank out stock art or kludge together a website, there&#39;s probably increased value for those sophisticated enough to use these tools in collaboration with their professional expertise.</p><p> What if we get genuinely general artificial intelligence? An application so advanced it can perform any cognitive task better than a person, or indeed, better than a person in collaboration with a machine? Chess seems to provide an illustrative example, with top chess engines picking better moves than top players—even those who have access to top chess engines.</p><p> In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we&#39;ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we&#39;ll all get <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">turned into paperclips</a> .谁知道？</p><p> But, despite the uncertain long-term forecast, I&#39;m fairly confident that the short-to-medium-term impact of tools like ChatGPT will not be to devalue learning complex skills and knowledge, but will actually increase the value of these activities. As with other technological advances that have come before, it will be the quick and enthusiastic learners who reap the benefits.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/">No, ChatGPT Doesn&#39;t Mean You Don&#39;t Need to Learn Things</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
