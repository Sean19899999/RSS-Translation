href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/14/a-little-announcement/">我的第二个孩子朱莉娅的出生</a>。我完成了第二本书《<em>在任何事情上都变得更好》</em>的手稿，该书将于 2024 年春季出版。我们也在新房子里度过了第一年，我们是在我上一次生日前不久搬进来的。</p><p>在生孩子的同时完成一本书让我很忙。最初的几个月是一种同步的混乱。我习惯了起床、送孩子去托儿所、去办公室写一整天、回家、做饭、打扫卫生、哄儿子上床睡觉，然后昏迷过去几个小时的断断续续的睡眠的节奏。 。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15324'

class="wp-block-heading">明年的计划</h2><p>除了出版这本书之外，明年我还有一些想做的事情。</p><p>一是提前完成更多每周的写作。虽然我发现论文写作很有趣，但自从几年前我更加非正式的日子以来，这项任务已经增加了。现在，每件作品都经过多次编辑，我经常做插图，并且我们录制<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/podcast/">播客</a>和<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ScottHYoungVid">YouTube 版本</a>。</p><p>每周写博客论文不是一份全职工作，但也不是一件小事。它往往会占用大量时间。有了孩子，这种影响变得更加复杂——即使是周末在家也会感到非常忙碌。因此，我明年的一个实验是批处理更多的写作，这样我就可以刻意培养一些更长的时间来完成新项目。</p><p>另一个目标是更多地旅行。在大流行和有两个小孩之间，我没有像我想要的那样经常旅行。但我同意泰勒·考恩的观点，他认为旅行是他工作的重要组成部分，而不仅仅是休闲。如果你总是被困在家里，为全世界的读者写作是很困难的。</p><p>最后，我想重建一些去年萎缩的锻炼习惯。我现在已经三十多岁了，我觉得与年轻时相比，坏习惯对我的健康和精力水平造成的损失更大。由于忙碌始终存在，“当我有时间时”去健身房长期以来是不够的。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">前进的道路</h2><p>弄清楚我一生想要做什么从来都不是一个简单的决定。相反，它总是不断地来回追求新方向并重新致力于旧方向。</p><p>我在职业生涯中经历过的一项斗争就是让我的工作走向更成熟的阶段。当写<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">《Ultralearning》</a>时，我知道我正在记录我生命中即将结束的一个阶段。我永远不会停止学习新事物，但我的生活已经远离了那种大型、大胆、面向公众的项目。虽然我对那些早期的努力零后悔，但我真的不想尝试重复地超越自己或迭代同一挑战的无尽变化。</p><p>在<em>Ultralearning</em>之后，我考虑了成为一名连载作者的道路。我第一本书的成功给了我写另一本书的机会。虽然我对这本书的结局感到满意，但写作过程的困难让我对计划每一两年推出一本新书犹豫不决。</p><p>回去读博士。这也是我多年来一直在考虑的一个选择。鉴于我的大部分写作都依赖于学术研究，我自己缺乏资历可能会在某些时候限制我的影响力。但我也发现学术界的官僚主义和专业化有些疏远，所以在这一点上，我很高兴成为一名业余爱好者。</p><p>最终，我最终走的路可能并不完全是有预谋的。相反，它将成为较小实验的副产品——写我喜欢读的东西并从事我认为有趣的项目。我永远感激能够承担这样的风险——这要感谢那些继续关注我的作品的读者！</p><p>帖子<a

class="wp-block-heading"> 1. 市场大多是有效的。大多数人，大多数时候，都无法“击败”市场。</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">有效市场假说</a>认为，广泛交易的证券（如股票）的价格反映了有关它们的所有可用信息的汇总。这意味着投资者无法发现“交易”或“定价过高”的资产，并利用这些知识来超越平均市场回报（无需承担更多风险）。 </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Expert-opnion1-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15308"

/></figure><p>其背后的机制很简单：假设您确实<em>有</em>资产定价错误的信息。你会被激励购买或做空该资产，期望获得比当前市场预期更好的回报。但这一行为会导致资产价格向相反方向调整，使其更接近“正确”值。总体而言，正是投资者试图击败市场的行动才使得市场变得如此难以击败。 </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Expert-opnion2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15303"

（在所有“预测”泡沫/崩盘的人中，有多少人从他们的预测中赚钱？）你认识的那个似乎从加密货币/房地产/细价股票/等方面获得了丰厚回报的朋友也不是。 （这通常是因为他们承担了更多的风险，因此拥有更高的风险溢价，并且很幸运。）</p><p>显而易见的结果是，对于大多数散户投资者来说，最好将资金投入基础广泛的指数基金，以获得多元化的好处，并以很少的费用赚取平均市场回报。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 智力是真实的、重要的，很大程度上是可遗传的，而且不是特别容易改变。</h3><p>这是我多年来一直努力接受的。这违背了我对自我修养、实践和学习价值的信念。然而，<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Intelligence-That-Matters-Stuart-Ritchie/dp/1444791877">证据确凿</a>：</p><ul><li>智力是最科学有效的心理测量之一（远远超过人格，包括可疑的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">迈尔斯·布里格斯</a>）。</li><li>它与我们生活中想要的许多其他事物呈正相关（包括幸福、长寿和收入！）。</li><li>它表现出很强的遗传性， <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">g因子的</a>遗传率可能高达85%。</li><li>最后，很少有干预措施能够可靠地提高智商，除了<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618774253">更多的教育</a>可能是个例外（尽管尚不清楚这是否可以提高 g）。 </li></ul><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"

/></figure><p>我不喜欢把这个论点说出来。我发现相信一个智商测试不能衡量任何东西的世界更有吸引力，或者他们不能衡量任何重要的东西，或者任何差异都是由于教育和环境造成的，或者你可以通过努力工作来提高你的智力。</p><p>也就是说，我确实认为这里有一线希望。虽然你的<em>一般</em>智力可能不容易改变，但有充分的证据表明，获得知识和技能可以提高你完成各种任务的能力。实际上，变得更聪明的最好方法就是学习很多东西并培养很多技能。由于知识和技能比一般智力更具体，这可能比我们想要的要少，但它仍然很重要。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. 学习风格并不真实。不存在所谓的“动觉”、“视觉”或“听觉”学习者。</h3><p>我为我的书<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">《Ultralearning》</a>接受过多次采访，主持人请我谈论学习风格。我总是必须非常温和地解释它们不存在。

href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/learning-styles-faq.html">学习风格并不是一个好的理论</a>。</p><p>我认为这个想法得以存在的部分原因是（a）人们喜欢占星术的心理对应物——这可能就是为什么迈尔斯·布里格斯（Myers Briggs）如此受欢迎，尽管它作为一种理论缺乏科学支持。而且，(b) 有些人只是更擅长想象、倾听或更灵巧，这是不言而喻的，这似乎与学习方式非常相似。但仅仅因为你篮球比数学好，并不意味着如果老师试图用三分球来解释微积分，你就会学得更好。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. 我们周围的世界完全可以用物理学来解释。</h3><p>肖恩·卡罗尔阐明了<a

5.人们超重是因为吃得太多。也确实很难停下来。</h3><p>从热力学角度来说，热量输入、热量输出模型是正确的。超重的人如果少吃的话就会减肥。</p><p>然而，这确实很难做到。正如<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/04/11/hungry-brain-review/">我与神经科学家和肥胖研究人员 Stephan Guyenet

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide">新型减肥药</a>持乐观态度的一个原因很简单，那就是，作为一个社会，我们的体重可能超过了最佳健康水平，而且大多数基于意志力的干预措施都不起作用。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. 儿童学习语言的速度并不比成人快，但他们确实达到了更高的掌握水平。</h3><p>常识告诉我们，如果你要学习一门语言，就要尽早学习。孩子们经常能流利地使用家庭语言和课堂语言，与母语人士没有什么区别；成年人很少这样做。</p><p>但即使孩子最终在发音和语法方面超越了成年人，也不能说孩子学得更快。<a

href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">《原子习惯》</a>或<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">《深度工作》</a>等超级畅销书属于同一类，但令她惊讶的是，它的受欢迎程度与它不同。</p><p>虽然得知你的作品被低估是一件令人深感荣幸的事情，但我认为有些人对适度流行的东西并不是超级流行的惊讶源于一种认知错觉。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么畅销书似乎很常见</h2><p>尝试想象你读过、看过或听说过的每一本书。那会是多少本书？</p><p>也许1000？</p><p>除非您是一位狂热的藏书家或从事出版工作，否则它可能不会超过 10,000。</p><p>现在尝试猜测实际写了多少本书。对于已出版的书籍，估计每年出版 50 万到 100 万本书。算上自行出版的图书，接近四百万册。美国国会图书馆拥有 3200 万册编目书籍，这比有史以来出版的每本书都要少。</p><p>这意味着您听说过的每本书（更不用说读过的书）只占现有图书总数的不到 0.00003%！</p><p>此外，您听说过的书籍并不是随机选择的样本。您听说过一本书的可能性与其在一般市场上的受欢迎程度密切相关。传统出版的书籍在其一生中通常会售出几千册。相比之下，超级畅销书的销量为数千万。</p><p>因此，普通读者对市场的了解如下： </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async"

YouTube 主播，却忽略了绝大多数订阅者不足 1000 的用户。我们听说过哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的精英科学家所做的研究，但没有听说过普通学者的工作。音乐、电影、新闻、体育和无数其他领域都遭受着同样的扭曲。</p><p>我非常感激能够让人们购买我的书，并邀请我参加播客。大多数人都没有得到这么多，即使是那些工作值得的人。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">质量怎么样？更好的书不是卖得更多吗？</h2><p>当然，畅销书并不是完全随机的。在詹姆斯·克利尔写<em>《原子习惯》</em>之前，我就一直羡慕他的写作能力，所以当他的书大受欢迎时，我并不感到惊讶。他是一位深思熟虑且富有魅力的作家。</p><p>虽然有些势利小人认为一本书的受欢迎是<em>低</em>质量的标志，但我认为这种看法反映了特定的品味，而不是描述大众市场的普遍特征。<span

class="wp-block-heading">您应该期待什么程度的成功？</h2><p>从本质上讲，这表明我们在图书出版等领域取得成功的能力被相当悲观地降低了。如果我们极大地夸大了畅销书的比例，那么我们就隐含地高估了我们成功的几率。</p><p>我认为这有一定道理。</p><p>极限水平上的成功通常是许多竞争因素的重叠，只有其中一些因素是您可以控制的。如果你个人对成功或幸福的定义取决于是否属于少数精英，那么这种分析应该会让你认清这一目标的现实。</p><p>然而，即使您追求的是较为温和的成功，这种思考方式也可以帮助您做得更好。当成功比你想象的要难得多时，你需要<a

href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604088">主要的争议</a>在于大脑是什么<em>样</em>的计算机，而不是它是否会计算。但我认为，来自这些领域之外的人对这一观点的更典型的反对是人文主义的。本质上，反对意见是：</p><ul><li><strong>计算机是有逻辑的；人类是有情感的。</strong>认知科学家会反驳说，情绪是一种计算。动机、注意力、恐惧、快乐和好奇心都是重要的功能属性。虽然算法的本质对于我们来说通过内省并不透明，但对于我们所有的认知过程来说，这基本上都是正确的。</li><li><strong>计算机没有感知能力；人类有意识。</strong>我<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Explained-Daniel-C-Dennett/dp/0316180661">同意丹尼尔·丹尼特（Daniel Dennett）的</a>观点，即<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">感受性</a>、 <a

href="https://www.amazon.ca/Consciousness-Brain-Deciphering-Codes-Thoughts/dp/0143126261">意识作为意识如何运作</a>方面已经取得了相当大的进展。</li><li><strong>计算机是受规则控制的；人类的思维是整体性的。</strong>当串行计算机模型在人工智能中更为普遍时，休伯特·德雷福斯（Hubert Dreyfus）<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mind-Over-Machine-Hubert-Dreyfus/dp/0029080614">提出了反对计算机类比的著名论点</a>。然而，我想“什么样的电脑？”上面的框架很大程度上解决了这个问题。据推测，大脑大量的处理器和巨大的并行活动解释了直觉和整体思维的力量（和局限性）。</li><li><strong>我们是谁，以为​​我们可以“理解”灵魂？</strong>最后的反对意见只是诉诸神秘主义。我并不是主要反对这一点——如果你更愿意沉浸在生命的奥秘中而不是试图弄清楚事情，那是一个合理的选择。但显然，这与科学的目标背道而驰。</li></ul><p>我们对大脑如何运作的了解还不如对微生物学的了解。

The response was great, so I decided to split my responses over two posts. You can see <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/07/12/reader-mailbag-range-learning-styles-nootropics/">last week&#39;s answers here</a> , where I talked about <em>Range</em> , learning styles, nootropics and the value of learning things you&#39;re doomed to forget.</p><p> Some questions have been lightly edited, and questions that multiple people asked have been merged into single questions. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Reader-mailbag.jpg" alt=""/></figure><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> How can I overcome procrastination?</p><p> <cite>(multiple readers)</cite></p></blockquote><p> The <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07">research on procrastination</a> indicates that we mainly fail to buckle down and get to work (or our studies) because we find the task unpleasant, and putting it off is more immediately rewarding than getting to work.</p><p> This seems a pretty banal observation, but it&#39;s important to note what it excludes. The research does not, for instance, find that perfectionism is strongly associated with procrastination (something widely believed). Nor is anxiety clearly associated with more procrastination (if you&#39;re anxious, you might even work harder!).</p><p> In terms of overcoming procrastination, I think this is why developing a productivity system—some kind of guiding framework that tells you what to work on and when—is so valuable. Over time, if you stick to the system, the decision of what to work on gets delegated to that system, and you learn to abide by it. That alone eliminates a lot of excessive procrastination.</p><p> However, I think it&#39;s also important to point out that procrastination is often useful! Our motivational hardware is designed to balance many competing interests and needs. A person pathologically incapable of procrastinating would also likely be willing to stick out working on a lot of tedious, low-value tasks.</p><p> While we want to keep our procrastination to an adaptive (rather than maladaptive) level, you should also embrace some of it as your motivational system functioning properly.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> What do you think of Stephen Krashen&#39;s Input Hypothesis?</p><p> <cite>(multiple readers)</cite></p></blockquote><p> Krashen&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">Input Hypothesis</a> is an influential (and controversial) language learning theory arguing that exposure to lots of language you can understand is both necessary and sufficient to achieve completely fluency in a language.</p><p> Additionally, Krashen has argued for a distinction between <em>learning</em> a language and <em>acquiring</em> a language, arguing that languages cannot be practiced (thus, there&#39;s no value in encouraging people to speak a language), nor can they be taught (thus, there&#39;s no value in explaining grammar or correcting people&#39;s mistakes).</p><p> Judging from the sidelines, I&#39;m somewhat baffled by the theory&#39;s popularity. Consider:</p><ul><li> <strong>For most skills, instruction tends to outperform unguided learning.</strong> The literature reviews for language learning show… <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00663.x">the</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00562.x">same</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229940242_The_Effectiveness_of_Corrective_Feedback_in_SLA_A_Meta-Analysis">thing</a> ? Yet this evidence is dismissed by proponents of Krashen&#39;s view as evidencing “learning” and not “acquisition.”</li><li> <strong>People in input-only learning environments <a href="https://scirp.org/reference/referencespapers.aspx?referenceid=476681">tend not to acquire native-level productive fluency</a> in a language.</strong> This suggests that the speaking part of immersive learning isn&#39;t superfluous.</li><li> <strong>Adults and adolescents over the age of 10-14 rarely achieve completely native proficiency in a language, despite decades of full-time exposure.</strong> Krashen&#39;s theory attributes this to an “affective filter” that prevents pure input from working its magic. It seems implausible to me that this can explain the near-universal success of six-year-olds in acquiring their native language but exceedingly rare odds of twenty-six-year-olds in achieving native-level pronunciation and grammar.</li><li> <strong>We already have a good idea of how we acquire implicit, fluent knowledge in other skills.</strong> Why would those same laws of skill acquisition not also apply to language learning? Even if there are language-specific mechanisms, it seems likely that adult language learners can also benefit from skill-learning systems.</li></ul><p> Outside of academic circles, Krashen&#39;s theory mainly influences language learners who prefer to read and listen as their primary method for learning instead of practicing conversation.</p><p> Despite <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">my preferred approach</a> , I&#39;m not against such approaches. Given that opportunities to speak a foreign language can be limited, you probably can go quite far just by reading and listening a lot. Even so, I think some speaking practice and formal instruction are also helpful for most learners.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> I find myself struggling with anxiety/depression, and it makes it harder to work on my key goals. What should I do?</p><p> <cite>(multiple readers)</cite></p></blockquote><p> My first suggestion in all these situations is that if you&#39;re struggling with obsessive, negative thoughts, seek therapy if you can, particularly therapists that work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive-behavioral therapy</a> , as it tends to have the greatest empirical support.</p><p> CBT tends to perform similarly to pharmaceutical treatments (which also seem to work well, so many people benefit from both). The basic idea behind CBT is that we can get into recurring patterns of thinking, feeling and action that mutually reinforce.</p><p> For instance, a person with social anxiety might have unpleasant feelings about going to a party. This triggers vivid imaginings about what might go wrong (maybe they say the wrong thing and embarrass themselves). The anxiety builds until they cancel the invitation and stay home. That causes some momentary relief, but it reinforces the thought and behavior patterns that led to that avoidance and entrenches the anxiety further.</p><p> Learning to notice and disable those patterns can be a major step to reducing their grip on you. If you cannot access therapy, I recommend reading more about cognitive-behavioral approaches so you can get the gist of what the work might look like.</p><p> Still, I&#39;m not a clinical psychologist, so what I say is not medical advice and ought to be taken with a grain of salt.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is a more effective approach: managing your day by tasks or managing your day by time/schedule?</p><p> <cite>– Tavan</cite></p></blockquote><p> I used to be a wholehearted advocate of the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/04/08/how-to-finish-your-work-one-bite-at-a-time/">task-based approach:</a> Make a daily to-do list and work on it until it&#39;s finished.</p><p> The benefit of the task-based method is that it focuses on getting work done. I find it works well when you have a bunch of predictable tasks that need doing, there&#39;s no pressing need to “do more” toward your projects, and you may have a strong urge to procrastinate. Ending when your tasks are done creates an incentive to get everything done so you can enjoy the rest of your day.</p><p> However, this approach can struggle when the projects you&#39;re working on are open-ended, or the tasks you&#39;re trying to work on are hard to predict in advance. In those cases, I rely on a fixed-schedule approach to productivity.</p><p> I think the issue of productivity systems is that there probably isn&#39;t a good <em>universal</em> system. Instead, different approaches work better or worse, given your typical tasks and goals. As a college student, I found the task-based system worked well. But I find it breaks down in other environments. Similarly, Cal Newport&#39;s <a href="https://www.timeblockplanner.com/">time-blocking system</a> works well when you&#39;re intensely busy and have many appointments on your calendar, but it may feel like overkill if you can get your work done without it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> I am curious to learn more about how blocking eyes might affect motor skill learning. A piano player or tennis player that do drills blindfolded or with one eye covered.</p><p> <cite>– Ola</cite></p></blockquote><p> I&#39;m not sure! My understanding of the motor skills literature is somewhat weaker than other aspects of educational psychology.</p><p> I know that when I was learning to touch type, we taped a sheet of paper at the top of the keyboard and typed underneath to prevent us from looking at the keys. That encourages you to look at the document you&#39;re transcribing and memorize the key positions directly. However, many other skills seem innately coupled to a visual/kinesthetic feedback loop, so doing it blindfolded would likely cause performance to deteriorate for an unclear purpose (I wouldn&#39;t ski down a mountain blindfolded, for instance).</p><p> I can say that introducing novel constraints is often a good way to “shift” a motor pattern into a new equilibrium that would be hard to achieve through conscious effort alone. There&#39;s interesting <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02701367.1999.10608029">research</a> showing that people tend to acquire movement skills better when they focus their attention on the goal of a movement rather than the movement itself. This suggests clever constraints may be beneficial to shift you out of a bad habit.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> Thanks to everyone who submitted a question to the reader mailbag.

Also, learning things that generally have answers—technical maths-based subjects, languages, etc.</p><p> Have you read <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214506">Range</a> by David Epstein?</p><p> What&#39;s your view on learning through trial and error, experiment, sense-making of existing past experiences that were not targeted but they happen to already be a part of you—(constructing them into your own personal specialism)?</p><p> <cite>-Jim</cite></p></blockquote><p> Range is a funny book for me because, in some ways, I&#39;m the epitome of its thesis. I&#39;ve learned a great deal of unrelated things and done a lot of random self-exploration. I write a blog about learning, in part because I&#39;m too fickle to stick to any one thing and master it completely.</p><p> That said, I think there are some broad empirical findings from educational and cognitive psychology that we need to keep in mind:</p><ol><li> <strong>Students <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">tend to learn better</a> in more guided and structured programs.</strong> Despite their appeal, unstructured, discovery-based approaches tend to underperform against more direct teaching methods unless you&#39;re stacking the deck in their favor. That doesn&#39;t mean learning through discovery is useless; simply that the effectiveness of learning through pure discovery doesn&#39;t have the evidence base people often claim it does.</li><li> <strong>Transfer between unrelated skills <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1249779.pdf">tends to be fairly low</a> .</strong> Learning tons of random things might have some benefit, but given the almost complete lack of “far” transfer in carefully controlled studies, I would say that the burden of proof is upon the person claiming transfer is large rather than the reverse.</li><li> <strong>Ill-defined skills (I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about when you&#39;re contrasting it to learning things that have an “answer”), I don&#39;t believe are different from well-defined skills.</strong> Indeed, a lot of what learning <em>is</em> is making a skill well-defined. If you don&#39;t know anything, the problem space is huge, and you are unsure of tons of possibilities. As you learn more, you find better ways to represent problems and better ways to solve them.</li></ol><p> I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with being a generalist and learning lots of things. Life&#39;s about more than optimizing for a singular goal.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Do you have any tips or strategies to learn more efficiently from books you read?</p><p> <cite>-Issam</cite></p></blockquote><p> I think the most important thing is just to read more. Reading more improves your fluency and background knowledge, which increases your reading rate. People really underrate how much reading a lot improves your reading speed.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> What about learning styles? Is being a “visual learner,” etc., a real thing?</p><p> <cite>-Chip</cite></p></blockquote><p>可能不会。</p><p> Daniel Willingham has a great summary of the <a href="http://www.danielwillingham.com/learning-styles-faq.html">evidence against the idea that people have learning styles</a> . To be a true “style,” it should mean that people learn better when information is presented in their preferred modality. Studies generally don&#39;t find increased learning gains from tailoring information in this way.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> How many things can we learn at one time? Should we just pick one thing and get to a certain level and then move on to others, or can we learn multiple things at the same time? Does it overload our brain, or is it capable of handling so much new info?</p><p> <cite>-Charitha</cite></p></blockquote><p> You can definitely learn multiple things in the same timeframe. Most of primary and secondary schooling is based on this. I tend to discourage multiple, concurrent self-directed learning projects because most people overestimate what they can accomplish and end up with several weak projects instead of one effective one. But there&#39;s no cognitive reason preventing it.</p><p> I think learning highly similar subjects in tandem can create issues. I&#39;ve never attempted to learn two new languages simultaneously, although I recommend practicing multiple languages in close succession for maintenance.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Do you have any supplements that you swear by for focus and productivity?</p><p> <cite>-Gareth</cite></p></blockquote><p> Caffeine? Honestly, not really anything.</p><p> I&#39;m not convinced about nootropics as something that could plausibly work with no downsides. For nootropics to make sense, you&#39;d have to believe that the brain <em>could</em> work better than it does, but the internal dials dictating its performance are simply set suboptimally. But why would evolution build a brain like this? If turning a dial could increase performance with no downside, evolution would have done so already.</p><p> My guess is that the true learning/focus enhancers will either have clear downside risks (eg, amphetamines), or they&#39;ll be targeted toward a particular deficiency/disability but not effective for the general population. I&#39;d be happy to be proved wrong here, but I&#39;d need to see a lot of good evidence first.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> I know some French as I lived in Quebec but left 30 years ago. What is the fastest way to learn it again in preparation for a trip to France in a few months?</p><p> <cite>-Harisch</cite></p></blockquote><p> Book some tutoring time with <a href="https://www.italki.com/dashboard">iTalki</a> and try chatting again.</p><p> For relearning, most of the issue is low fluency and self-confidence. It&#39;s less work since the knowledge is probably already in your head—it&#39;s just not as automatic. A few lessons should help you feel more fluent, which will also help with confidence which can be a big part of speaking a language.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> If you had to do the MIT Challenge all over again knowing what you know now about the scientific literature on learning, productivity, etc., what would you have done differently and why?</p><p> <cite>-Jeff</cite></p></blockquote><p> I initially dreamt up the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> as, “I wonder if you could learn all the CS courses MIT teaches?” and then further, “I wonder if I personally could do it in 12 months if I just focused on the exams.” As such, it was somewhat contrived since the aim was passing exams rather than acquiring the skill for a particular purpose. I&#39;ve said as much over the years, but the project would have looked entirely different if my end goal had been landing a programming job, launching a start-up, or becoming a researcher.</p><p> In terms of what I know now, there are a few things I can see as weaknesses that could have been remedied with a different approach. I passed a lot of exams by having a decent conceptual understanding. Still, my procedural knowledge of algebra/calculus was weak, which led to me struggling with the physics-based classes with a lot of math to wade through to compute the answer. If I did this project over, I&#39;d do massive drills to build up that fluency, maybe as a prerequisite project to starting the challenge itself.</p><p> Similarly, while I did the programming projects, the MIT CS degree was light on actual programming. It was a lot more theory and math. That&#39;s fine, but if I had intended to land a programming gig right after, I&#39;d have spent a couple months going deep on a particular language, ensuring I could fluently implement a lot of ideas I had covered.</p><p> Overall, I&#39;m not sure I would have changed much about how I studied. The timeframe constraints didn&#39;t leave much wiggle room to do things wildly differently. But if I had the broader goal of learning programming or computer science, I could imagine a lot of different approaches that might have better results for some purposes.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Why do I enjoy reading nonfiction since most is forgotten? Why do we test high-school students on content “finals” when we know most of the material will be forgotten?</p><p> <cite>-Rob</cite></p></blockquote><p> Things are forgotten, but they often still influence us in an impressionistic way. I often find my beliefs have been shifted in a direction even though I no longer recall the exact source of the argument. Some of what reading books does is shift your intuitions about situations in ways that don&#39;t always leave a trace back to their source.</p><p> _ _ _</p><p> That&#39;s it for this week. Next week, I&#39;ll tackle some more questions including overcoming procrastination, my thoughts on the contentious input hypothesis in language learning, motor skills and more!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/07/12/reader-mailbag-range-learning-styles-nootropics/">Reader Mailbag: Range, Learning Styles, Nootropics and the Value of Learning Things You&#39;re Doomed to Forget</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/07/12/reader-mailbag-range-learning-styles-nootropics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Eight of My Unanswered Questions About the Best Way to Learn</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/27/unanswered-questions/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/27/unanswered-questions/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Wed, 28 Jun 2023 03:15:02 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15228 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Some puzzles about the best way to learn.

Yet there&#39;s still a ton I don&#39;t know!</p><p> Today, instead of offering answers, I&#39;d like to pose some questions I still have. I&#39;ll frame each question in terms of a specific topic, but each likely speaks to a broader issue that impacts other skills and subjects.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> My Unanswered Questions</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. When learning a broad subject, like history, how much time should be spent on retrieval practice versus new reading?</h3><p> I&#39;ve written before about the value of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1199327">retrieval practice over re-reading</a> . Give students an essay to read, and they learn more when they practice free recall of the essay&#39;s contents than if they re-read it again.</p><p> But the research here focuses on re-reading the same essay again. What about reading a different source? If you&#39;re studying a broad topic like history, do you learn more from retrieval activities or reading many other books and sources?</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Is it better to first watch a foreign language film with subtitles or without?</h3><p> Say you&#39;re watching a film in a language you are learning. You aren&#39;t to the point where you can understand what&#39;s happening from the first viewing. If you&#39;re going to watch more than once, should you watch with subtitles on the first or second viewing?</p><p> The argument for the first viewing would be that you&#39;d understand the plot and thus could better assimilate language on the second viewing. The argument for the second viewing is that you&#39;d attend to the words better and process them for meaning.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Should you start by struggling on challenging math problems or simply view the instructions?</h3><p> This isn&#39;t just my question—it&#39;s a hotly debated area of educational research. Manu Kapur&#39;s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543211019105">productive failure</a> experiments argue in favor of presenting difficult-to-solve problems first. In contrast, others&#39; experiments on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">cognitive load theory</a> argue in favor of starting with explicit instructions.</p><p> Both theories support problem-solving as you gain expertise, as it provides needed practice. But the question is whether beginners, who are unlikely to know the correct solution beforehand, benefit more from problem-first or examples-first approaches.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. How many words in a new language should you study via flashcards?</h3><p> I&#39;m a big fan of learning vocabulary with flashcards. At my peak, I had around 16,000 cards for Mandarin and several thousand for Korean and Macedonian.</p><p> Memorizing the central meaning of a word is much faster to do via flashcards than incidental exposure. Yet a flashcard only teaches you part of what you need to know about a word. You can&#39;t get a feel for when the word is likely to show up or what words it goes with, and you need practice to recognize and use it in context.</p><p> My hypothesis is that flashcards are useful—but only to a point. Common words are good to learn, as are some uncommon ones. But how far should you go? The most common 100, 1000, or 9000 words? Should you focus on single, core meanings or quiz yourself on variations (eg, one card for “divide” versus cards for “divide,” “division,” “divisive,” etc.)</p><p> Learning a new word incidentally is almost always slower than learning it deliberately. Still, it has the added advantage of the complete context, plus additional practice on the other words in the context. At some point, learning words “in context” will probably become more efficient than rote memorization. The question is where this trade-off point occurs.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. If you&#39;re learning to ski or snowboard, do you learn faster if you stick to the easy slopes and perfect your technique or take on the steepest slope you can comfortably manage?</h3><p> For cognitive skills, there&#39;s support for getting the method “right” from the beginning. If you learn a mathematics algorithm incorrectly, there are few opportunities to self-correct that knowledge later.</p><p> However, there seem to be different schools of thought for physical skills. One school would argue for perfecting the “correct” technique before moving on. This is the view that sloppy technique is hard to fix later, so it should be mastered before taking on harder challenges.</p><p> Another school would argue that once you&#39;ve intellectually understood the technique, you benefit more from practicing in difficult/varied situations rather than trying to perfect it in an easier setting. Yet those complex settings likely to introduce errors and thus lead to long-term headaches.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. How useful is learning academic computer science for a successful programmer?</h3><p> This question has been on my mind since my <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a> . On the one hand, knowledge of number theory, analysis of algorithms and logic play a role in programming practice. On the other hand, who has ever sat down to prove the complexity class for a problem before they begin working on it?</p><p> This question of the relationship between academic theory and practical skills shows up in many fields. Opinions on academic relevance range from, “Of course, you need to learn that!” to, “Nobody has ever used this on the job.”</p><p> Possible answers include:</p><ul><li> It helps, but mostly with advanced work, not entry-level work.</li><li> It helps by making the practical skills “make sense,” assisting with future learning.</li><li> It doesn&#39;t help much with programming, but it helps you land a job.</li><li> It&#39;s less efficient than simply learning programming directly.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Do you gain greater chess proficiency by playing slower or faster games?</h3><p> Say you want to increase your chess score rapidly. Should you focus on longer games, where there is more time to think for each move, or faster games, which have less time to think, but you end up seeing more board positions for each hour spent playing.</p><p> I suspect both ends have an extreme where learning benefits break down. Spending a year per game, or spending less than a second per move, is probably not efficient. But where does the optimal point sit in between?</p><p> While this question matters for chess, of course, definitively answering it would say a lot about other skills which can be done at varying “speeds” and have trade-offs between depth of analysis and quantity of exposure.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. If you want to paint in a “loose” style, should you first learn to paint with “tight” control?</h3><p> Similar to playing chess fast and slow is the question of cultivating an artistic style. Suppose you want to paint in a “loose” or “painterly” fashion. Would it make sense to learn with greater control first and then loosen up as you gain experience, or should you paint relatively loose from the start?</p><p> The argument for starting with greater control is that much of what we like in skillful, loose painting styles is that the artist can communicate much with an economy of movement and brushstrokes. Beginners can&#39;t do that, so they&#39;re better off learning the fundamentals and loosening up as they get better.</p><p> An analogy for this might be math: An experienced mathematician can simply shout out the answer to a complex question, whereas a beginner would need to do the calculations ploddingly by hand to get that same answer. We would never expect just shouting out an answer to be a way for a beginner to gain the expert&#39;s knowledge.</p><p> The argument for starting looser is that the skill of controlled painting is different from looser works.

Intensive projects are hard to schedule, challenging to execute and may lack sufficient spacing for long-term retention.</p><p> The best approach isn&#39;t to steadfastly stick to a particular format for working on a goal but to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. So, today I&#39;d like to explore what sorts of learning minimal habits are actually useful for.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What are Minimal Habits Good For?</h2><p> The minimal-habit approach to learning, provided you can sustain it over long periods, has two key advantages: spacing and convenience.</p><p> Spacing refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> , a well-studied phenomenon. We retain information better when there are longer intervals between when we are exposed to it than when the same amount of exposure happens over a shorter amount of time. Thus, seeing a vocabulary item ten times over ten days will result in more durable memory than seeing it ten times in one hour. By drawing out learning over very long timeframes, minimal habits can potentially take advantage of the spacing effect and, thus, result in more durable memories than crammed schedules.</p><p> The second advantage of minimal habits is that they&#39;re convenient. As I mentioned in the previous essay, it feels mean to discourage people from cultivating minimal habits since the alternative is often to do nothing. Life is busy, learning is hard, and sometimes you only have ten minutes to spare.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15217' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15217' title="This argument is somewhat refuted when people have &lt;em>;several&lt;/em>; minimal habits to learn different things, which suggests that they could work on one thing at a time but have difficulty deciding which to focus on."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Given these two advantages, I think it&#39;s worth examining what types of learning aims might be appropriate for a simple, minimal habit spread over a very long time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> When Should Minimal Habits Work?</h2><p> Based on my mental model of minimal habits, I would expect them to work when the practice activity has low cognitive load and can be fit into a small space of time.</p><p> The basic idea behind <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">cognitive load theory</a> is that information must make its way through a narrow bottleneck of conscious experience for learning to occur. Complex subjects and skills, those with many pieces of information that must all be put together before you can understand them, create a high cognitive load. This is one reason why learning mathematics and physics is difficult.</p><p> However, cognitive load isn&#39;t constant for a subject! As you learn, your brain uses mechanisms, such as chunking or retrieval cues, to minimize the burden on your working memory. For example, when you first learn to read, it has a very high cognitive load because you must work to recognize each letter. But eventually, the cognitive load of reading becomes low as you automatically recognize words and sentences.</p><p> New learning varies in its demands on working memory. Some skills and concepts are intrinsically higher in cognitive load since they have many new, interacting parts. In contrast, other ideas are essentially isolated from each other and can be learned one at a time.</p><p> Consider learning to calculate quantum-mechanical orbitals in chemistry versus memorizing masses on the periodic table. The former has a lot of pieces of information that all need to be used simultaneously to perform the calculation. In contrast, the memorization task involves (mostly) unrelated facts.</p><p> In light of this, flashcards might help you memorize the periodic masses, but they wouldn&#39;t work well for learning to solve the differential equations to find electron orbitals. The kinds of problems in the calculation task require that you “load” a lot of information into short-term memory so that, for all but the most seasoned chemists, the effective practice activity would look more like a problem set that you must focus on for some time.</p><p> <strong>Minimal habits are probably better for maintaining knowledge and fluency than moving to a new skill frontier.</strong> Continued, repetitive practice spaced over time is ideal for boosting fluency, but it&#39;s less effective for making deliberate adjustments in the presence of corrective feedback.</p><p> Thus, a low-key daily writing habit will probably make writing <em>easier</em> , but it may not help you reach a substantially higher level of proficiency. The latter would presumably require deliberate practice constraints that force you to use styles or structures that don&#39;t come automatically and require a certain amount of focus and effort (and likely some outside feedback). This is difficult, or impossible, to sustain as a minimal habit.</p><p> The other constraint on minimal habits is that the practice activity needs to fit—and be effective—in a sliver of time each day. Thus downhill skiing, for instance, probably can&#39;t be made into a minimal habit by most people since it requires a lengthy trip up a snowy mountain before you can get some runs in. Many skills are difficult to practice minimally because no relevant kind of practice will fit into that timeframe.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Examples of Where Minimal Habits Might Work</h2><p> I&#39;ve used minimal habits in the past—both effectively and ineffectively. The theory articulated above spells out where I think they work (and where they fail). In particular, I think minimal habits might work well for:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad subject knowledge.</strong> Daily blog reading, educational YouTube videos or skimming a relevant subreddit will not produce expertise. Still, it can give you good <em>coverage</em> of the main ideas, even if you&#39;d need serious practice to become proficient in using them.</li><li> <strong>Flashcards and memorizing isolated facts.</strong> Things that can be made into atomic, independent pieces of quickly-testable knowledge are also good candidates. I&#39;ve successfully used fragments of time to learn a lot of vocabulary, and it can be good for maintaining knowledge, too.</li><li> <strong>Fluency and maintaining established skills.</strong> Keeping effort minimal can help build fluency with material, a non-trivial part of eventual mastery.</li></ul><p> In contrast, I expect minimal habits to be poorly suited to situations requiring deliberate practice; learning new, complex skills; or when effective practice is not possible within the time/effort constraints demanded by the minimal habit.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that the patient/impatient distinction is often dwarfed by the larger consideration of time actually spent learning. According to <a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">some reasonable estimates</a> , mastery of a language can take 500-2000 hours of classroom time. If you were to follow the five-minutes-per-day approach with a “hard” language, like Mandarin, that would mean almost seventy years before you hit that threshold! If you don&#39;t actually practice enough, even the most efficient learning strategy won&#39;t get you there.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">When are Minimal Habits Useful for Learning?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Problem with Being Too Patient</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15198 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Is patience a vice or a virtue in learning?

After all, getting good at things takes a long time, and only those who are in it for the long haul can expect to reach the pinnacle of their craft.</p><p> Given that common association, I found it interesting to hear the opposite perspective from <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pro-Lessons-Father-Claude-Harmon/dp/0307338045">Butch Harmon</a> , Tiger Wood&#39;s coach during the best years of his golfing career:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Those golfers who insist on being patient and letting the game come to them rarely play up to their potential. They play well, maybe win a time or two, but they never reach the great heights their talents dictate. The players who want to learn, get better, and win right now—this second, no waiting—are the ones who exceed their natural abilities and become the game&#39;s great overachievers.</p></blockquote><p> Harmon later goes on to explain why Tiger was one of the least-patient people he had ever met:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> When Tiger wants to do something with his golf swing, he wants it done now. No phasing it in and no long-term planning. Once he decides to make a change, he makes it fully and immediately. Then he works himself ragged until he perfects it, exhibiting little or no patience along the way.</p></blockquote><p> In Harmon&#39;s view, patience was often wishful thinking: the hope of future proficiency preventing you from really working today at what you want to improve.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Five-Minutes-Per-Day Problem and Learning Hard Things</h2><p> Harmon&#39;s quote made me think about a phenomenon I&#39;ve often seen in self-improvement circles. It is the idea that what matters most for learning is doing a tiny bit of something, every day, over a long period of time.</p><p> This approach is exemplified by the language learner who plans to become fluent in a language by playing on Duolingo for five minutes a day, the would-be novelist who commits to writing one page a week, or the aspiring photographer taking one picture a day.</p><p> It feels mean to be discouraging of this approach. After all, most people do nothing toward their aspirations, so doing something, even a little bit, is better than nothing. Isn&#39;t it?</p><p> However, I can&#39;t help but feel that this approach is akin to the wishful thinking exemplified by Harmon&#39;s “patient” golfers—people who used the slowness of eventual mastery to dodge the demanding work of learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Logic of Minimal Habits</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s probably helpful to revisit why this approach is so popular in self-improvement circles. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">Atomic Habits</a> , a fantastic best-seller written by my friend James Clear, is one of the most obvious proponents of the “start small” approach to self-improvement.</p><p> The logic of habit-building is compelling:</p><ol><li> Starting is hard.</li><li> Small habits are easier to commit to.</li><li> Once you start, it&#39;s easier to ramp up and do more.</li></ol><p> Thus, the logic goes, the person who does ten minutes a day on Duolingo is building momentum for a larger habit of practicing speaking with people. By lowering the bar for entry, they begin the self-improvement process, while having high expectations may have made it too hard to get started.</p><p> Phrased this way, the logic of minimal habits is undeniable. I think it&#39;s an important behavioral technique for getting started with anything, especially when the thing you&#39;re trying to do feels unpleasant. I have used this approach to get back into exercising when I haven&#39;t felt like doing so. I would never criticize someone for starting with smaller, enjoyable habits to break into something they find frustrating or unpleasant but want the outcomes of.</p><p> My concern is with #3. Theoretically, it&#39;s easy to ramp up and do more once you&#39;ve started. But in practice, the minimal habit often becomes the destination, not a warm-up for something bigger. And I&#39;m skeptical that such “patient” approaches to practice will reliably result in substantial improvements.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How Effective is the “Patient” Approach to Mastery?</h2><p> I&#39;m not aware of any research that specifically pits “five-minutes-per-day” habits against more typical curricula for skills people want to master. The costs and difficulties of longitudinal studies mean that empirical research is generally somewhat scant over extended time frames.</p><p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> in psychology would seem to support the slower, patient approach. Memories tend to be more durable when there are longer intervals between reviewing information than when the same review is massed together (as when cramming for a test). However, real-world studies of language learning <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/07/learning-fast-or-slow/">tend to find the opposite</a> , finding that more intensive curricula have the edge over more stretched-out approaches.</p><p> My guess is that which approach is more effective, whether five minutes daily or intensive bursts, depends on the exact nature of the skill being learned, the practice activities used, and the knowledge the learner begins with. I suspect that complex skills favor a more intensive approach, whereas broad, knowledge-based subjects tend to favor a more patient approach.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15198' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15198' title="A full discussion of exactly what sorts of skills (or sub-skills) benefit from different learning schedules is outside the scope of this essay. Learning vocabulary via flashcards, for instance, seems well-suited to an extended schedule, but the procedural fluency needed for conversations probably benefits from a more intensive one. Similarly, learning about history by watching recorded lectures can probably be done leisurely, but developing the analytical skills of a historian will require a more focused approach. My point here is that my argument that certain categories of “long-term habits” are ineffective for their purpose shouldn’t be misconstrued as the opposite point that an intensive schedule is always better for acquiring all types of skills."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> However this kind of analysis is probably beside the point because, in general, the sorts of things people do for learning when they opt for a five-minute daily habit are categorically different from those they would do in a typical classroom setting or as part of a focused learning project.</p><p> Here, “patient” approaches suffer from several serious drawbacks:</p><ul><li> <strong>Limited time constrains the types of practice you can do.</strong> In five minutes a day, you can complete an exercise on Duolingo, but meaningful conversation practice needs more time. Watching a video of someone painting can be done in five minutes, but replicating that painting yourself takes more time.</li><li> <strong>A focus on “sustainability” avoids necessary effort</strong> . When you pick activities designed to be sustainable over months or years, there&#39;s a bias against picking anything too effortful or time-consuming. This eliminates a lot of the intense, deliberate practice needed to achieve mastery.</li><li> <strong>Long timeframes make it harder to tell if you&#39;re making progress</strong> . Improvement is evident when you&#39;re learning a lot over a few months. If you&#39;re not making progress, you change your approach. When improvement is something expected to occur years in the future, how do you know if you&#39;re actually getting better at the underlying skill?</li></ul><p> For these reasons, I&#39;m skeptical of many of the proposed plans I&#39;ve heard from readers to achieve mastery via simple, long-term habits.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Mastery is Slow—and Impatient</h2><p> In his research on <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">deliberate practice</a> , Anders Ericsson articulated the view of mastery that most closely corresponds with my own. He argued that mastery is a slow process, and also an impatient one:</p><ul><li> <strong>Mastery is slow because it takes a long time</strong> . No, <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> is not an exception to this. I do think it&#39;s possible to learn more efficiently, and that effectively-designed projects can help people accomplish more than they think possible. But genuine mastery (not just relatively quick intermediacy) requires a long time, and nothing I&#39;ve worked on is an exception to that rule.</li><li> <strong>Mastery is impatient because the work required is deliberate, effortful and striving</strong> . Deliberate practice was Ericsson&#39;s term to describe the kind of learning efforts put in by elite performers in chess, music and athletics. It clearly describes Tiger Woods, Harmon&#39;s most famous student.</li></ul><p> I believe this is true even if you don&#39;t aspire to world-class greatness. Even getting “good enough” requires a level of commitment that&#39;s difficult to reach with minimal habits alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">The Problem with Being Too Patient</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 19:54:47 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15181 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Flashcards should be the base for learning any memory-intensive subject, mnemonics layered on top (if that).</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Suppose you have to memorize a lot of material—vocabulary words in a new language, terminology for an anatomy class, legal precedents, or dates of historical events.

Everyone has done them before. They&#39;re dry and elementary. You put a question on one side, the answer on the other and you drill (and drill and drill) until you can do them without thinking. No fantastical imagery or secret method. Just repetition.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Flashcards are Underrated</h2><p> While mnemonics might seem like the obvious choice for learning a ton of new information, research rigorously comparing the efficacy of various studying strategies paints a somewhat different picture.</p><p> In their excellent review of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/Z10jaVH/60XQM/full">ten popular studying techniques</a> , Dunlosky and colleagues summarized the research on both the keyword mnemonic method and practice testing (which includes flashcards). In this review, practice testing got the highest possible rating for usefulness, while the keyword mnemonic got a low grade.</p><p> The keyword method does work—that is, students who use it tend to remember the words they were memorizing better than those who didn&#39;t. But it had a number of limitations:</p><ul><li> <strong>It takes time to learn and teach mnemonic methods.</strong> Unlike flashcards, mnemonics is itself a skill that requires considerable practice to get good at. While this may benefit elite mnemonists, it may not be worth the additional investment for those who simply want to learn Spanish, law or anatomy.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics often take a good deal of time, especially for beginners.</strong> It may take a few minutes to create a good link with the keyword method, in which time you could have done several repetitions with flashcards. One study, which equalized the time-on-task between mnemonics and more rote memorization, found that simply increasing repetition provided an advantage over using the mnemonic.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonics greatly assist with recall over relatively short intervals, but their benefits might not endure.</strong> This makes mnemonics useful in memory competitions—events that require memorization of highly arbitrary information with near-immediate recall. In contrast, much of what we&#39;re trying to memorize needs to stay in our heads for much longer.</li></ul><p> Flashcards, in contrast, are simple and quick. While all memory fades eventually, the repetitive overlearning caused by flashcards is one of the more durable ways to create long-term learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Direct Retrieval is the End Goal of Learning</h2><p> Empirically, mnemonics are a bit of a mixed bag. Flashcards seem to have the advantage, at least in carefully controlled studies of longer-term recollection in students who aren&#39;t already trained in mnemonic techniques.</p><p> Cognitive theory also lends support to this perspective. A major feature of skill acquisition is that the methods used to achieve a result are not constant. For <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emerging-Minds-Process-Childrens-Thinking-ebook/dp/B000QTD49E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">instance</a> , children learning simple addition start by counting both numbers on their hands, then count from the bigger number and finally retrieve the answer directly.</p><p> As expertise develops, more elaborate methods tend to be replaced by direct retrieval of the answer. This is one reason that expertise can be relatively effortless—instead of going through an elaborate process to get to an answer, you just remember it.</p><p> Mnemonics, in this light, can be seen a little bit like the finger-counting. The vivid imagery acts as a bridge between two concepts that would otherwise be difficult to associate. You can quickly learn the mnemonic and it enabling you to cross over from one idea to the other. However, if you practice enough, the two ideas get directly associated—with no intervening imagery.</p><p> For situations where fluency is particularly important, such as recalling vocabulary words while speaking, the direct retrieval option is perhaps necessary for a majority of words in order to not get bogged down while speaking too much. This suggests that even if you initially learn a word via mnemonics, direct retrieval will eventually take over as it becomes the faster option.</p><p> This suggests that mnemonics are, at best, a temporary measure. They may make learning an association easier, in the short-to-medium term, for words that haven&#39;t been sufficiently overlearned to form a direct association. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15190" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Why-Flashcards-are-Better-than-Mnemonics-for-Studying2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Not Both?</h2><p> Of course, flashcards and mnemonics are not mutually exclusive. You can use the keyword mnemonic when you first encounter a flashcard and then study it repeatedly. In this way, the temporary bridge offered by the mnemonic may be beneficial to learning.</p><p> This is the approach I&#39;ve used when I&#39;ve had to memorize a lot of material. I start with the keyword mnemonic, when that is relatively easy to do, and follow with a lot of spaced retrieval practice to make the association automatic and robust.</p><p> However, I think it&#39;s worth examining the relative efficacy of the two techniques for a few reasons:</p><ul><li> <strong>Many people get overly excited about mnemonics and use them instead of flashcards.</strong> I think this is often ill-advised for the reasons I&#39;ve articulated above.</li><li> <strong>Sometimes the material isn&#39;t mnemonics-friendly.</strong> I found the keyword mnemonic great for learning vocabulary in European languages—but far less helpful for Asian languages. The “sounds like” method doesn&#39;t easily discriminate between words in Chinese (which all sound like each other much more than they sound like words in English) so the first leg in the bridge is weak. However flashcards continued to work and were my primary tool for learning Chinese and Korean vocabulary.</li><li> <strong>For those not trained in mnemonics, it&#39;s worth asking how much time should be invested in acquiring the skills needed.</strong> While mnemonics have some valid use cases, they are often slow and cumbersome without lots of practice, meaning they are best reserved for situations where they&#39;re likely to be used across many memory-intensive subjects.</li></ul><p> In short, if you are proficient with mnemonics, by all means, use them to supplement your flashcards. If you&#39;re not, or your subject makes using them difficult, or you simply aren&#39;t sure which one to prioritize, stick with the flashcards.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/">Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
