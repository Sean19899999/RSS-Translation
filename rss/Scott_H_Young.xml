</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>一位读者给我发电子邮件，列举了一些突然改变生活的人的例子：他们开始锻炼，养成更好的习惯，努力学习并取得好成绩，在他们的职业生涯中取得进步……基本上一夜之间就把自己变成了“成功”的人。他想了解为什么会发生这种情况，并询问人们如何尝试进行类似的转变。</p><p>我在其他人身上看到过几次这种性格变化，所以我相信这种现象是真实存在的。我的一些朋友突然变得更有动力、更认真、更有条理和更有野心——通常会为他们自己带来更好的生活成果。</p><p>这也是我亲身经历过的事情。当我大约十五岁时，我改变了饮食习惯，开始早起、定期锻炼、读书并尝试各种提高工作效率的方法。虽然转变发生在几年而不是一个单一的时刻，但它仍然是我性格中一个相当突然的方向变化，最终成就了今天的我。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p>暂时假设我的内省自我报告和轶事观察是准确的，我认为读者的问题很重要，值得进一步讨论。为什么人们有时会突然变成更好的自己？也许更重要的是，为什么它经常失败？</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">发现自我实现</h2><p>由于找不到更好的术语，我将这种转变称为发现自我实现。这听起来含糊不清，但这是我描述这种体验的最佳方式。如果您对自助行话过敏，也许另一种描述方式可能是“成为成年人”或“齐心协力”。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>就我而言，我认为这些变化是由我的信仰体系的根本重组引发的。也就是说，我开始相信在我的人生决定中有相当大的自主空间，而且如果我做出明智的选择，这些决定可能会对我的人生结局产生重大影响。</p><p>想要自己创业也是一个重要的触发因素。自己当老板和拥有完全的财务独立的内在吸引力，加上实现该目标的内在困难，起到了催化剂的作用。事实上，我认识不少人在职业抱负的背景下发现了自我实现。</p><p>对于其他人来说，触发器是更具体的东西。他们读了一本改变了他们世界观的书（对很多人来说是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> ）。他们遇到了一种新的宗教、哲学或精神实践（<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">正念冥想</a>似乎是另一种常见的改变触发因素）。</p><p>即使确切的原因是特殊的，我也看到了一些共同的特征：</p><ul><li><strong>相信有比我们现在生活更好的生活。</strong>中心前提是存在广泛的可能期货，其中许多优于默认。即使在拒绝大多数野心的哲学观点中，这似乎也成立。例如，那些对正念冥想感兴趣的人常常拒绝职业抱负应该成为生活中心的想法。但他们仍然相信正念会让他们体验到更好的生活质量。</li><li><strong>自我效能突然普遍提高。</strong>虽然<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura 最初的概念</a>非常精细，但似乎确实存在一些时刻，您会更有信心在更广泛的行动中取得成功。</li><li><strong>增加延迟满足和抵制冲动的价值。</strong>愿意努力工作，做让你感到不舒服的事情，以及抵制你眼前的习惯和冲动的意愿也在起作用。在相对较短的时间内，可能难以坚持锻炼计划的人突然接受了数十项高强度挑战。</li><li> <strong>（过度）热心应用上述更改。</strong>通常，经历过重大范式转变的人对他们生活的替代版本的价值过于乐观，对自己的执行能力过于自信，并且过于关注自我提升而不是一时的满足。</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">怀疑论者的批判</h2><p>当然，我并不是第一个注意到这种现象的人。许多自助大师围绕向人们推销变革性的生活改变建立了他们的整个营销帝国。尤其是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">托尼·罗宾斯 (Tony Robbins)</a> ，似乎对这些时刻非常重视。</p><p>持怀疑态度的人会争辩说，这些变化通常不会持久。炒作消退，虽然对某事感到兴奋很容易，但我们很少会永久改变我们的性格或行为。</p><p>我倾向于同意怀疑论者的观点——大多数时候。我怀疑大多数人一生中都会经历一次或两次这样的转变。很多人可能永远都没有经历过。相反，变化通常是渐进的、没有方向的。有时我们的状态会好一点，有时我们会放手。大多数自我提升的爆发都会回归到平均水平。</p><p>然而，考虑到这些戏剧性变化的重要性，我们不应该将它们的概率四舍五入为零。在你的生活中经历一两次这样的时刻可能会弥补许多其他失败的改善自己的尝试。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么会发生？为什么会失败？</h2><p>我对这些个人转变的推测理论是：</p><ul><li><strong>你的乐观、自信和努力的价值暂时发生了变化。</strong>这种瞬间的效果可能来自于阅读一本自助书籍，有一个激励你去做某事的榜样，或者有一个私人的顿悟。</li><li><strong>环境创造了一个自我维持的反馈循环。</strong>看到这种正反馈循环的最简单方法是设定一个目标，实现它，然后突然向上偏向你对自我效能或信心的其他估计。</li><li><strong>一旦最初的反馈循环消失，你的生活就已经处于一个足够“不同”的位置。</strong>你的习惯和个人身份的物质环境已经转移到一个新的平衡位置，你现在保持它。</li></ul><p>根据这一理论，大多数自我提升的努力都以失败告终，因为一时的热情爆发不会产生自我维持的反馈循环，而你达到的平衡是<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">亚稳态的</a>。最终你会变回原来的你，因为有很大的引力把你拉回到原来的样子。</p><p>即使发生了这种变革性的变化，我认为它能走多远也可能是有限的。人们<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">对其可塑性的看法</a>因实际数字而异。有些人突然对自己变得受欢迎、成功、聪明、开明等的能力变得难以置信地乐观，以及相反，人们对自己抱有固定的看法，认为改变是不可能的。</p><p>我在其他人身上目睹的转变往往涉及适度不切实际的信念。这就提出了一个有趣的问题，即一定程度的自欺欺人是否有助于进入新的平衡状态，即使它是不可持续的。如果那是真的，尽管遭到怀疑论者的强烈谴责，但这种脱离现实的小突破实际上可能是关键——对一个人的可能性进行真正清醒的评估可能不足以鼓励你的信念发生短暂的改变，从而转向新的平衡。</p><p>与此同时，似乎也很明显，大多数变化都没有这么大。发现自己可以掌控自己的生活，这可能是您一生中只能真正做一两次的事情。一旦在你的信念中坚定地确立了这一点，相比之下进一步的调整可能是微不足道的——调整你的习惯、技能或观点。</p><p>由于世界上到处都是推销和说服他人采用自我实现信念集（即使它部分是妄想）的人，一个相关的问题是为什么这种转变相对罕见。我怀疑它们更难维持，因为虽然很容易找到灵感来源，但找到保持动力持续的积极反馈循环要困难得多。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">你能改变自己吗？</h2><p>鉴于我们中的许多人都希望我们的生活方向突然发生积极转变，我们可以做些什么来促进这种转变？ </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。虽然我已经多次亲眼目睹，但变化本身是其他事物的副产品，而不是积极寻求它的人。</p><p>但是，我确实认为有一些通用成分可能会增加这种变化的可能性：</p><ul><li><strong>成功与自我设定的抱负。</strong>在这里，自我效能感似乎是一个重要的激励因素。仅仅知道建立企业、学习语言或保持健康是可能的是不够的。你必须相信<em>你</em>能做到。虽然完成一件事并不一定会转化为全面的动力，但取得更大的成功可能会鼓励提高自我效能。</li><li><strong>阅读大量具有鼓舞人心但可信信息的书籍。</strong>如果适度的自欺欺人在启动这些转变中发挥了作用，那么你从阅读励志材料中获得的暂时提升可能会增加你达到拐点的机会。但是如果你不相信它，灵感就会失败。因此，找到对你来说似乎可信的乐观来源比仅仅选择最俗气的自助标题更重要。</li><li><strong>寻找具有挑战性的、有价值的目标。</strong>至少就我自己而言，我觉得创业的愿望是一种催化剂。一个有吸引力的目标和知道除非我真的努力工作否则我不会成功的结合似乎至关重要。</li><li><strong>更多的随机性。</strong>最后一个催化剂是让你走出舒适区的经历。这里的想法是，你的日常经历中更大的可变性会增加你偶然发现一个改变你人生轨迹的积极反馈循环的可能性。</li></ul><p>最后，我不完全确定为什么有些人会沉迷于个人生产力、正念冥想、每天锻炼、创业或成为一名全优学生。我不知道为什么他们的生活方向似乎在经历了一次特定的经历后突然发生了变化。但我同意给我发电子邮件的读者的看法，即使这种转变很少见，但它们似乎很重要，而且人们知之甚少。</p><p>

Young</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>最近，<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/">我在这里请读者</a>分享他们如何使用像<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a>这样的大型语言模型 ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLM</a> ) 来学习和研究。今天，我总结了其中的一些建议，并试图综合关于何时（以及何时不）使用这些工具进行学习的建议。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">法学硕士的优势和劣势</h2><p>使用像 ChatGPT 这样的应用程序需要小心。</p><p>部分困难在于 ChatGPT 的类人对话能力可能具有欺骗性。感觉您正在与真人交谈会鼓励您依赖机器可能无法满足的对话期望。</p><p>例如，我们通常认为大多数人不会编造事实。然而，大型语言模型通常会提供可能完全错误的流畅答案，从而违反这种期望。在这些应用程序中，了解您不知道的内容的元认知能力不发达。</p><p>我们的另一个期望是语言流利程度会追踪智力的其他方面。我们希望能够从莎士比亚的台词中脱颖而出，解释量子计算，并在押韵诗中证明素数定理的人也能够计算。因此，天真地将 LLM 视为真正聪明和知识渊博的人可能会适得其反。</p><p>撇开这些注意事项不谈，ChatGPT 显然有助于完成一系列任务。西蒙·威利森 (Simon Willison) 建议将法学硕士视为“<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/">单词计算器</a>”——可以对文本做有用事情的东西——而不是通用智能或聪明人。</p><p>我倾向于同意。我们越能区分 LLM 工作良好的情况和（还）不工作的情况，我们就越能利用新功能而不会陷入意想不到的陷阱。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> ChatGPT 的十大有用学习策略</h2><p>在收到来自我的听众的数十封关于他们个人如何使用 ChatGPT 学习的电子邮件后，我整理了一些技巧和一些最常见的建议。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1.创建你自己的苏格拉底导师。</h3><p>到目前为止，读者报告的最常见用途是将法学硕士用作个人导师。</p><p>要求 ChatGPT 解释棘手的概念、不熟悉的代码或问题似乎是 LLM 可能做得很好的领域。而唯一合理的替代品（人类专家）是出了名的昂贵且供不应求。</p><p>如果你结合课堂或教科书这样做，犯错的风险似乎也会降低，因为你仍然有一个主要来源可以进行比较。挑战与你在书中读到的内容不一致的解释，而不是相信人工智能所说的一切。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 练习用新语言聊天。</h3><p>人们使用 LLM 来更好地学习的下一个最常见的方式是作为语言导师。这似乎是一项 LLM 非常适合的任务。不管它们有什么其他缺陷，它们都可以生成语法正确的文本。</p><p>许多人与 ChatGPT 建立对话，这样当他们感到困惑时，人工智能可以在他们正在学习的语言和英语解释之间来回切换。很可能，这些解释可能不完美，但人类导师也经常对他们设法熟练使用的语法和词汇给出错误的解释。</p><p>另一种用途是重写文本，使其达到更适合初学者的阅读理解水平。分级读者和综合输入是学习用另一种语言阅读的好策略。不幸的是，学习材料通常很少或无趣。您可以使用 LLM 将您想要阅读的以流利的母语水平编写的文本转换为适合您当前能力的文本。</p><p> Duolingo 似乎<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">也加入了 LLM 游戏</a>。我一直对早期版本中使用的拖放式语言学习方式很苛刻，但这些新进展可能会迫使我修改我的观点。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. 生成较长文本的摘要。</h3><p>摘要是法学硕士似乎擅长的另一个领域。已经存在用于<a href="https://consensus.app/">生成期刊文章或研究主题摘要</a>的消费者应用程序。</p><p>一些读者表示，他们正在使用这些人工智能工具来提供大量阅读材料的摘要，帮助他们在各自领域保持领先地位。</p><p>好的摘要，尤其是那些针对您的特定需求进行微调的摘要，可能是导航我们在知识工作中经常面临的大量信息负载的好方法。您可以使用它来帮助确定要深入阅读的文档的优先级，或者做第一遍组织不熟悉的材料。

无法打开链接直接进行总结，但它经常会像我上面使用的那样用著名的文本产生幻觉。在这个功能成为消费者应用程序的标准之前，最好是复制+粘贴。</p></blockquote><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. 长文档对话。</h3><p>法学硕士还可以帮助您对较长的文本“提问”。例如，在阅读科学论文时，您可以快速查询样本量或询问方法或结果。<a href="https://consensus.app/">共识</a>在提供参考的同时做到了这一点，因此当您可以轻松地仔细检查 LLM 的工作时，出错的风险似乎会降低。</p><p>虽然这里有更多奇特的用法，例如人们要求 ChatGPT 冒充给定的作者并与他们对话，但我怀疑能够询问文档的自然语言问题并接收带有参考的回复是处理大文本的有用工具。</p><p>也就是说，您必须准备好对 LLM 的答案进行事实核查。例如，在下面捕获的对话中，我要求 ChatGPT 列出支持强引导指令的证据，它引用了<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.59.1.14">Mayer 的一篇评论文章</a>。但它错误地声称 Mayer 的工作是一项荟萃分析，但事实并非如此。事实上，这篇论文甚至不是一篇全面的文献综述，而只是简单地考察了发现学习失败的三个突出案例。如果从表面上看，这种反应可能会产生误导，但如果您知道 AI 正在转换的是什么文本，则“检查”AI 的工作相对容易。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img

以不同的解释深度重写文本。</h3><p>遵循专家思维的一个主要困难是大多数专家级的文本都是为其他专家编写的。概念无法解释，缺乏上下文，行话比比皆是。这意味着大多数人必须依赖翻译人员，例如一般市场上的非小说类作家或科普作家，他们以更易读的格式呈现专家的想法。</p><p>这里似乎有两种使用人工智能工具的方法。一种是简单地要求 LLM 用更简单的术语解释一个流行的概念，例如：“像我是八年级学生一样解释量子计算。”另一种是向 ChatGPT 提供文本或解释，并要求 AI 以更易于理解的方式重写。</p><p>我倾向于认为后者更可靠一些，因为您拥有可以比较的源材料，而不是相信 ChatGPT 的话。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. 清除不熟悉的行话。</h3><p>几年前，我记得读过泰勒·考恩 (Tyler Cowen) 的<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">边际革命 (Marginal Revolution) 博客</a>，我对他频繁、无法解释地使用“施特劳斯”一词来描述思想或其他思想家感到困惑。我在谷歌上搜索了解释，但没有任何结果。</p><p>经过大量研究，我大致理解了这个词的意思，“仔细阅读杰出思想家思想的字里行间，寻找他们真正的意思，但由于盛行的审查制度和知识分子的正统观念而不能总是表达出来。”</p><p>如果在我困惑的时候 ChatGPT 存在，我就可以得到这个： </p><div

class="wp-block-heading"> 7. 制定学习计划和议程。</h3><p>这种用法让我感到惊讶，但它在读者的回复中出现了足够多的次数，所以我把它放在这里。人们似乎喜欢使用人工智能来告诉他们如何以及何时学习。</p><p>例如，一些读者要求 ChatGPT 分解一个复杂的学习目标并给他们一个课程。其他人更愿意走得更远，考虑到他们当天的限制，他们要求 ChatGPT 为他们制定学习时间表。</p><p>我可能不相信 LLM 会为我提供精心设计的学科课程。但如果我正在学习一些全新的东西，那可能是一个不错的起点。有时，进入一个新领域最困难的部分是打破看似无法逾越的目标。同样，有时被告知何时学习可以帮助克服入门的惰性。</p><p>虽然技能故障可能没问题，但 ChatGPT 仍在努力创建阅读列表、混淆书籍和参考资料。因此，虽然它可能很好地分解一个模棱两可的学习任务，但我不相信它会给我很好的资源（目前）。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. 复习被遗忘或不常用的工具。</h3><p>程序员是回答我查询的最大专业群体。我不能说这是因为编程特别适合法学硕士，还是因为程序员作为一个群体更有可能采用新颖的软件工具。</p><p>程序员的生产力优势似乎显而易见。这些天我写的代码不多，所以我没有太多使用 LLM 的这个广为人知的功能。但由于很多编码都是相对常规的，让机器为算法创建初稿的能力显然可以节省大量时间。</p><p>虽然有些零编程知识的人依赖 AI 输出来构建应用程序，但我怀疑这些可能很难调试和维护。相比之下，专业程序员可以针对他或她特别熟悉的语言覆盖 ChatGPT 的输出。</p><p> LLM 似乎真正有效的地方是在程序员专业知识的边缘。许多程序员告诉我，他们发现人工智能有助于在不熟悉的语言或工具中获得入门提示。他们的编程经验基础使他们能够理解并实现输出，但他们对底层语言的不熟悉意味着 AI 为他们节省了很多时间。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. 根据文本生成抽认卡。 （暂定的）</h3><p>抽认卡是一种强大的学习工具。制作它们也很麻烦。</p><p>一些读者表示，他们正在使用 ChatGPT 为他们正在学习的科目生成抽认卡。这似乎完全符合 LLM 作为“单词计算器”的能力。因此，使用正确的提示，您可以获得相当不错的结果——前提是您输入的是您希望看到的转化为抽认卡的材料，而不是指望 LLM 自己获得事实（见下文）。</p><p>然而，考虑到制作“好的”抽认卡的难度，我不会在没有先复习的情况下将任何内容输入我的 Anki。尽管如此，制作抽认卡还是很乏味的，所以拿到初稿供我稍后复习可能会大大加快这个过程。如果您在将卡片放入套牌之前确认卡片的正确性，风险似乎相对有限。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. 用它来整理你的笔记。 （先进的）</h3><p>作为一个做了大量研究的人，我经常浪费很多时间来寻找我的笔记。罗伯特·马丁发现了同样的问题。通过关键字搜索很麻烦，因为有时您不记得您使用的确切术语，即使含义大致相同。</p><p> Martin 通过使用 LLM 的嵌入特性<a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2023/02/05/gpt-for-second-brain/">解决了这个问题</a>。虽然不是严格意义上的 ChatGPT，但这个属于自然语言处理技术家族的工具可以让您找到语义相关的注释，而不是精确的关键字匹配。</p><p>驻留在您的硬盘驱动器上并访问您现有数据的个性化 LLM 可能是一个有价值的应用程序。我希望能够搜索我知道我见过但不太记得在哪里的东西。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">有些事情不要做</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. 不要指望 AI 会弄清事实。</h3><p>法学硕士经常<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">编造东西</a>。如果您依赖 ChatGPT 给出正确答案，这些幻觉就会出现问题。现在很难说这些错误的普遍性。例如，当维基百科发布时，“专家”就该网站的用户生成性质如何意味着它永远不能被视为来源而大声疾呼。除了维基百科<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438900a">实际上做得相当好</a>，而且其中一些下意识的反应是错误的。</p><p>法学硕士在事实方面还没有达到维基百科的质量，我们仍然不知道他们什么时候可能得到正确答案，什么时候可能编造东西。目前，最好将它们用于错误答案成本最低的情况，因为您可以在经过验证的来源中查找它，或者因为您对 AI 的使用本质上不是事实。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 不要指望 AI 能正确引用。</h3><p>虽然法学硕士有时会搞砸事实，但他们在正确引用引文方面似乎很糟糕。 They frequently invent authors, papers, studies and research.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t use a LLM for any research that I needed to cite, and I would always double-check the sources it does provide.</p><p> Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t ask an LLM to give me a reading list or references to specific books or authors (unless, possibly, the authors were quite famous and likely to be well-represented in the data set).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Don&#39;t expect AI to get the math right.</h3><p> I believe it&#39;s a mistake to attribute general intelligence to LLMs based on their ability to do many tasks at a human level or beyond. As with chess bots and image classifiers, the technology behind LLMs is extremely narrow compared to what we would expect of a human who scored similarly on verbal tests.</p><p> One finding from psychology is that much of reasoning is performed by different subsystems in the brain than those devoted to language. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">This paper</a> argues that LLMs seem to match the neurological evidence from double-dissociation studies: you can have fluent verbal abilities with seriously impaired reasoning and vice versa.</p><p> As such, LLMs are really bad at math. And not just higher-level math that humans struggle with. LLMs often fail at <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt">basic counting tasks</a> . Thus I suspect LLMs would be uniquely bad at a task like providing practice problems for a math class and grading the answers. ChatGPT might be able to explain a math concept well, but be unreliable at actually using it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Have you used ChatGPT or other AI tools to further your learning?

However, before I share that post, I&#39;d like to address a different question.</p><p> One question a few readers have is whether ChatGPT will eliminate the need to learn things. After all, if you can easily ask the machine a question and it will spit out an expert-like answer, what&#39;s the point of getting students to write essays, memorize facts or try to remember a lot of knowledge?</p><p> Like everyone, I&#39;m gobsmacked by the performance of large language models like ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. That said, it&#39;s hard to predict things, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">especially about the future</a> . And I suspect the evolution of new AI tools is harder to predict than most things. We have poor intuitions about what sorts of problems machines can solve, and so the general discourse around AI as a field tends to swing between wild pessimism and optimism as we learn more about the path ahead.</p><p> One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won&#39;t make learning obsolete.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Learning Still Matters</h2><p> One reason I can feel confident about the continued value of learning is that while ChatGPT is novel, the kind of technological change it has brought about is not.</p><p> Humans have been inventing technology that has replaced aspects of cognitive work for thousands of years. In every case, the result of that substitution was not a diminishing of the need for skills and knowledge—but an increase.</p><p> Consider the impact of writing. Human knowledge used to be transmitted orally. When writing became available, thinkers such as Socrates decried the damage it would do to people&#39;s memory. We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down.</p><p> Or consider calculators, which have been widespread for decades. You probably have one on your smartphone. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p><p> A robust finding in educational psychology is the importance of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Why-Knowledge-Matters-Rescuing-Educational/dp/1612509525/ref=asc_df_1612509525/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=296035595995&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17947244405290068344&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001551&amp;hvtargid=pla-464465047333&amp;psc=1">background knowledge</a> . People who know more about a subject can understand and retain more of what they read. Knowledge outside your head doesn&#39;t count, since it can&#39;t participate in learning and reasoning.</p><p> Similarly, even if you use a calculator all the time, you understand math better when you first learn to do it by hand. Working through low-level calculations creates conceptual and procedural skills that build an intuitive sense for the underlying algorithms. While you can save effort by using a calculator, the intuition you gained from your initial learning helps you recognize if the calculation is correct and how to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p> The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Will ChatGPT Change What Knowledge Matters?</h2><p> So perhaps we can safely reject the extreme position that learning will become obsolete. Won&#39;t LLMs change what <em>kind</em> of knowledge is worth learning?</p><p> This is probably the case. But it&#39;s not obvious to me what the transition will be, and I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s intuitions on this are correct either.</p><p> The gut reaction seems to be that since large language models can easily spit out an explanation to any question answerable within the sphere of well-documented human knowledge, LLMs devalue this kind of book learning.</p><p> Even putting aside the hallucinations and failings of current LLMs and assuming engineers perfect the technology to the point where it rarely gets these questions wrong, I&#39;m not sure this intuition is correct.</p><p> As mentioned in the research on background knowledge, your ability to ask a useful question and then understand an LLM&#39;s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess. For instance, economist and polymath Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/what-is-the-single-best-way-of-improving-your-gpt-prompts.html">argues</a> that asking an economics question to ChatGPT goes better if you ask it to answer in the style of Milton Friedman or Paul Krugman. Your own economics knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a new phenomenon. If the answers to all the world&#39;s questions were already on the Internet, but you didn&#39;t know where to look, they&#39;d be invisible to you.</p><p> Contrary to the supposition that book learning will be less relevant, I suspect that it will be <em>more</em> important. The people who get the most programming help from ChatGPT are existing programmers—since their knowledge allows them to ask well-formulated programming questions and accurately assess the results. LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Subjects/Skills are Still Worth Learning?</h2><p> A few people wrote to me wondering whether it even makes sense to learn second languages, programming, creative writing or art, given the ever-increasing powers of these applications.</p><p> My feeling is that, on the whole, the value of these skills hasn&#39;t changed much. What will probably change is the differential value of mastery versus novice levels of various skills. There may be fewer professional opportunities available for mediocre programmers, writers, artists or translators. This kind of skill polarization has been going on for a long time, as I documented in my book <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . ChatGPT is just a continuation of current trends.</p><p> But just as there&#39;s a diminished value for someone who can crank out stock art or kludge together a website, there&#39;s probably increased value for those sophisticated enough to use these tools in collaboration with their professional expertise.</p><p> What if we get genuinely general artificial intelligence? An application so advanced it can perform any cognitive task better than a person, or indeed, better than a person in collaboration with a machine? Chess seems to provide an illustrative example, with top chess engines picking better moves than top players—even those who have access to top chess engines.</p><p> In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we&#39;ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we&#39;ll all get <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">turned into paperclips</a> . Who knows?</p><p> But, despite the uncertain long-term forecast, I&#39;m fairly confident that the short-to-medium-term impact of tools like ChatGPT will not be to devalue learning complex skills and knowledge, but will actually increase the value of these activities. As with other technological advances that have come before, it will be the quick and enthusiastic learners who reap the benefits.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/">No, ChatGPT Doesn&#39;t Mean You Don&#39;t Need to Learn Things</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15058 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A summary of my views on how transfer of learning works, based on research.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Transfer occurs when learning one thing helps you learn or do something else. It&#39;s arguably the most important issue in educational psychology. After all, we spend years in the classroom. One would hope the things we learn make us more productive on the job, conscientious as citizens or intelligent in our daily lives.</p><p> Yet it turns out the titular question is really difficult to answer. This is because the answer depends on three different questions, each of which is itself incredibly complicated:</p><ol><li> How do we perform skills?</li><li> How do we acquire them?</li><li> What sorts of skills are used in real life?</li></ol><p> About two years ago, I started a research project to learn everything I could about transfer. It quickly became clear that understanding transfer depended on answering the other three questions, so my research broadened drastically.</p><p> Despite two years of research and a lot of writing about transfer (including a chapter of <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> ), I still don&#39;t have a definitive answer for how much transfer we can expect. But I&#39;d like to share at least how I&#39;ve come to think about the issue.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question One: How Do We Perform Skills?</h2><p> Essentially, transfer is a product of overlap. We should expect transfer from one skill to another when something in those two skills is essentially the same. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15068" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Nearly every well-articulated theory of transfer is an overlap theory. What differs between theories is the “something” which potentially overlaps. Let&#39;s consider some candidates:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad mental faculties.</strong> In <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/formal-discipline">this framework</a> , “reasoning” or “memory” overlap across different skills. This theory likens the mind to a muscle that can be strengthened through many types of practice. This would suggest transfer is quite broad and that almost any strenuous mental activity should produce benefits.</li><li> <strong>Stimulus-response.</strong> Perhaps, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorists</a> , the mind is merely a collection of habits, stimulus leading inevitably to response? This view would suggest transfer is extraordinarily limited—every superficial change in a situation would require a new skill.</li><li> <strong>Propositions and productions.</strong> Theories like <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/02/15/act-r/">ACT-R</a> argue that our brains store skills in essentially two forms: small chunks of factual knowledge and simple component procedures. Complex skills and knowledge are simply aggregates of these foundational pieces.</li><li> <strong>Schemas.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">Schema-based theories</a> claim that knowledge is organized in patterns larger than individual actions or chunks. These patterns roughly correspond to “templates” with both fixed and variable components. For instance, we might have a “birthday party” schema that includes birthday cake and presents, but only optionally clowns or pointy paper hats.</li><li> <strong>Neural networks.</strong> The brain is made out of neurons, and we have some idea of how those neurons process information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">Connectionist</a> theories take these basic neuronal properties as a starting point and posit theories of learning based on them. Teasing out implications for transfer is harder here, but it would most likely look like an overlap in the synaptic connectivity between two skills.</li><li> <strong>Activity systems.</strong> Perhaps transfer isn&#39;t in our heads but is a property of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">broader social and physical environments</a> ? In this view, the person relies on their environment to perform a skill, and transfer fails when those environmental supports are altered.</li></ul><p> Only the first two seem to be demonstrably false. The <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/09/13/brain-training-doesnt-work/">mind is not like a muscle</a> , nor is it a simplistic stimulus-response device.</p><p> I find the information-processing perspective of cognitive science to be the most persuasive. The mind is essentially computational (although quite different from computers made out of transistors). Answering the question of transfer depends on how the algorithms for skills are composed.</p><p> From this perspective, what seems safe to say is that skills can only reliably influence each other if they overlap in either their procedures or knowledge. If two skills don&#39;t use the same process, and the knowledge they depend on is different, there shouldn&#39;t be much (if any) transfer.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15058' title="I’m leaving aside analogies. Analogies suggest two domains that have nothing to do with each other may actually be a source of transfer. But another way of saying this is that analogies suggest an abstract commonality between two superficially different domains. When analogies are useful, they tend to share an overlapping deep structure, so I would include them as an &amp;#8220;overlap&amp;#8221; theory, even if the overlap is an active process rather than the nature of the mental representations themselves."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Two: How Do We Acquire Skills?</h2><p> How the mind represents skills is only one part of understanding transfer. There&#39;s also the issue of how we acquire these representations. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15069" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Here, a few things seem pertinent:</p><ul><li> <strong>Expert-novice differences.</strong> Experts appear to represent ideas at a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220480253_Categorization_and_Representation_of_Physics_Problems_by_Experts_and_Novices">deeper level than novices</a> . The most likely explanation is that skills become more abstract as we encounter more examples and learn to generalize and distinguish concepts.</li><li> <strong>Automaticity effects</strong> . Skills tend to recede from conscious awareness with experience. There are many different proposed mechanisms for this in psychology, but a consequence seems to be that how the expert <em>thinks</em> they perform a skill may not fully capture what they&#39;re actually doing.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15058' title="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Read-Thinking-Learning-about/dp/0262510766/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678392728&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;science on reading&lt;/a>; seems relevant here: careful experimentation seems to indicate that fluent readers decode words letter-by-letter, even though we may feel like we recognize meaning holistically as we look at text."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li> <strong>Mnemonic effects.</strong> Another complication is that even if there is no overlap between two skills in expert performance, there might be an overlap at an earlier stage of acquisition. Vimla Patel has explored this in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10401338909539394?journalCode=htlm20">medical cognition</a> . She comments on the finding that basic science tends to be used infrequently in clinical practice. However, that doesn&#39;t mean learning basic science is useless for doctors because it forms a scaffolding for making sense of clinical knowledge, thus aiding in its acquisition.</li><li> <strong>Declarative-to-procedural transitions.</strong> Another characteristic progression in learning is for skills to start as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a> —things we know and think about explicitly—and shift to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">procedural knowledge</a> —actions we take automatically. This transformation implies that skills may have different patterns of transfer at different levels of mastery as their dominant mental representation changes.</li><li> <strong>Cognitive load.</strong> Different training activities work better for <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">different stages of skill acquisition and working memory capacity</a> . Studying an example, for instance, is better than solving a problem when cognitive load is high, but the opposite is true when cognitive load is low. Efficiency of practice, then, is more than just a question of overlap but also of the stage of learning. Early on, drills, practice on component skills and structured lessons are more helpful. Later on, complex, realistic practice matters more.</li></ul><p> On top of these psychological details, there&#39;s the issue of pedagogy. There are often multiple methods for teaching something. Those methods have varying levels of generality and can apply to a broader or narrower range of concepts. Transfer, then, also depends on how something is taught.</p><p> My sense from reading this research is that there are a few pitfalls to avoid:</p><ul><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer potential by the abilities of novices.</strong> Novices have a more superficial, context-bound understanding. That&#39;s more indicative of their phase of skill acquisition than the ultimate potential for transfer.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer on one-shot problem-solving tests.</strong> Problems often require many pieces of knowledge and procedures to solve correctly. Failure in the tested task could mean a complete failure of transfer, or it could mean that a person is 99% of the way there but still missing one piece. A better test is to train a person on task A, then on task B, and measure the time savings on B from the knowledge and skills acquired in A.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t trust experts&#39; perceptions of how they do a task.</strong> Experts are<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Ourselves-Discovering-Adaptive-Unconscious/dp/0674013824">bad at introspecting</a> their cognitive procedures. We tend to underrate knowledge we&#39;ve already acquired, seeing it as obvious. The ease of automaticity fools us into thinking the complex skills we perform are simple. This can lead to an inappropriate devaluing of “basic” skills.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Three: How are Skills Used in Real Life?</h2><p> The final question is about the kinds of cognitive activities people engage in during work, school and daily life. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15070" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> While possibly the most relevant question of the three, it is also the hardest to answer. Few studies have looked systematically at the kinds of cognitive skills people regularly employ at work and at home.</p><p> Critics allege that much of what we learn in school has little real-world application.</p><p> John Anderson <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Memory-Integrated-John-Anderson/dp/0471249254">reports</a> that employers either want very basic skills (which the educational system should already be teaching) or highly specific skills that no universal curriculum could aspire to. Similarly, Peter Cappelli <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Good-People-Cant-Jobs/dp/B00FJUFFD8/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Smadj&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_p=22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_r=138-5005353-2745032&amp;pd_rd_wg=vgzAZ&amp;pd_rd_r=36883576-42ee-403e-89ee-0ccca61e0046&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk">argues</a> that surveys show employers tend not to highly value academic skills.</p><p> Jean Lave <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cognition-Practice-Mathematics-Culture-Everyday/dp/0521357349/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UHF1GP7YERE1&amp;keywords=jean+lave+cognition+in+practice&amp;qid=1681499209&amp;sprefix=jean+lave+cognition+in+practic%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-2">found</a> that the mathematics taught in school is rarely what people use in their daily routines.</p><p> Bryan Caplan <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652">argues</a> that much of education is signaling—showing others we have smarts, conformity and work-ethic—rather than cultivating those abilities. From this perspective, the real purpose of schools is to sort people, not to teach useful skills. School knowledge doesn&#39;t apply to real life, Caplan argues, because that&#39;s not the function it serves in society.</p><p> Supporters of education argue that just because most skills aren&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re useless. We may become specialists of one sort or another, but unless we assign everyone a career at birth, we want to maintain maximum flexibility until our adult years. A side-effect of this desire to maintain flexibility is that we end up learning a lot that we don&#39;t ever end up using, or that is insufficiently concrete to apply in practice without further training.</p><p> Similarly, education proponents <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mindware-Tools-for-Smart-Thinking/dp/B0719GQ4GZ/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=284313338521&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9001556&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=15299944356742459999&amp;hvtargid=kwd-314760458336&amp;hydadcr=14950_9480932&amp;keywords=mindware+nisbett&amp;qid=1681499263&amp;sr=8-1">point out</a> that just because a skill isn&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be. Statistics is a powerful tool for reasoning about many important issues. The fact that people are statistically naive shows we should be teaching them more, not declaring it impotent!</p><p> Whether we apply a skill in a new context depends on the effort it requires. Practice can lower the effort of applying a skill in real life and create more situations where it is convenient to use. Imagine rewinding time to before widespread literacy; it would be perverse to argue that reading isn&#39;t useful because most people don&#39;t read.</p><p> My perspective is that, while many academic subjects aren&#39;t used, it&#39;s difficult to appreciate a subject until you learn it. Given that we generally cannot “infer” a domain of knowledge simply by encountering problems that apply it, this argument favors accumulating more knowledge than you think you&#39;ll need.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Side Note: Transfer of Effort, Motivation and “Noncognitive” Skills</h2><p> Thus far I&#39;ve been looking at transfer through a cognitive lens. A somewhat separate issue is the transfer of things like the ability to focus and study for long periods of time, the ability to resist temptations, or the motivation to want to learn.</p><p> Many of the same arguments used above apply to noncognitive skills as well. There&#39;s unlikely to be something like a general faculty you can improve with bulk training efforts for motivation, persistence or focus.</p><p> That said, the arguments about transfer here are somewhat different because these are not complex skills (in the information processing sense of “complex”). Sitting at your desk and focusing for eight hours may be difficult, but it&#39;s not <em>computationally</em> demanding.</p><p> Thus while I think it&#39;s ridiculous to imagine improving your memory by memorizing Latin verbs, it&#39;s not ridiculous to imagine improving your ability to focus by regularly sitting down to focus. Believing that cognitive skills are highly specific, and should show limited transfer, is not logically incompatible with a more general transfer of effort or persistence. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15071" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I might write a fuller summary of my views later, but I want to clarify that while “speaking French” and “being able to focus” are both discussed as skills, they have a different locus of difficulty. French is hard because there are lots of words, grammar and mental processes you need to perform it. Focusing is hard because the naive reward center of your brain wants to go on Twitter instead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Summarizing My Thoughts on Transfer</h2><p> If you take one thing from this article, it should be that transfer is complicated.</p><p> As a practical takeaway, I would agree with roughly the following:</p><ul><li> Transfer should be minimal between unrelated skills.</li><li> Transfer between related subjects depends on how much they overlap in content and procedures, with the caveat that those content and procedures may extend beyond what is traditionally thought of as the curriculum.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15058' title="For instance, I tend to think learning Chinese will help with later learning Spanish, even though there is virtually no overlap in the vocabulary or syntax. Instead, what is transferred is a more abstract understanding of languages and how they are learned."><sup>3</sup></a></span></li><li> Academic subjects can transfer to real life, but this transfer can fail because:<ul><li> We are missing components of the skill for applying it. This can include “recognizing” when an academically learned skill applies (for instance, applying algebra to a real-life quantitative problem).</li><li> We haven&#39;t automated the skill enough to pass the cost-benefit threshold.</li><li> We can&#39;t actually perform the skill with only our academic ability.</li><li> Many academic skills are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_knowledge">inert</a> , but they&#39;re still potentially helpful for accelerating learning that builds upon them.</li></ul></li><li> All else being equal, practice on more cognitively similar tasks should maximize overlap and, thus, future transfer. However, there are important exceptions to this because of cognitive load, retrieval effects and overall difficulty. Therefore identifying the most beneficial practice activity may be more complicated than simply matching it with the activity you&#39;re trying to get good at.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15058' title="This is a major misconception I had when I wrote my “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/&quot;>;do the real thing&lt;/a>;” piece."><sup>4</sup></a></span></li></ul><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 11 Apr 2023 23:50:55 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15030 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Ten interesting papers on the science of learning and thinking.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/">Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;ve shared <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/05/03/more-recent-reading/">some</a> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/">reading</a> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/11/7-books-learning/">lists</a> based on my research for my upcoming book.

Students are often bored and disengaged in lectures. They fail to transfer what they learn to the real world. Real life involves active effort and problem-solving, whereas so much of traditional schooling seems to be regurgitation of memorized facts.</p><p> The authors here argue that those intuitions are misguided. The research favors strongly-guided forms of instruction. Methods in which skills are carefully explained and taught consistently outperform methods that rely on students discovering, inventing or creating their own solutions.</p><p> This paper attracted enough controversy that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Constructivist-Instruction-Success-Sigmund-Tobias/dp/0415994241/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=duffy+tobias+constructivist+education+success+or+failure&amp;qid=1634325516&amp;sr=8-1">an entire book</a> was created with various experts weighing in on both sides.

A Taxonomy for Far Transfer</a> by Susan Barnett and Stephen Ceci</h2><p> Transfer is undoubtedly the most important issue in education. We&#39;re engaging in transfer whenever we learn something in one setting and apply it in another. Thus, the utility of any school, book, course or training experience hinges on transfer.</p><p> Despite this, many more studies report failures of transfer than robust successes, and the causes of this have been endlessly debated.</p><p> Barnett and Ceci review some of the research while adding that what we call “transfer” can really be broken down into several different dimensions, such as:</p><ul><li> Transfer between domains (eg, learning about exponential growth in a biology class and applying it to the stock market)</li><li> Transfer between contexts (eg, learning to multiply in school and then applying that at the grocery store)</li><li> Transfer over time (eg, learning something in 9th grade and applying it during your working life)</li></ul><p> My opinion is that resolving questions about transfer is so difficult because they&#39;re actually questions about how the mind works. Knowing how much transfer is possible hinges directly on how the mind represents skills and knowledge.

Bloom&#39;s challenge was to see if any pedagogical techniques could approach the gains seen with tutoring but could apply to a classroom with dozens of students.</p><p> Bloom believed he had found an answer in mastery learning. In this approach, students are given many interim tests. Those who fail to master the material are given new explanations, practice and an opportunity to try again. The idea is that catching difficulties early will prevent them from becoming ongoing problems.</p><p> While most meta-analyses of mastery learning put the effect size closer to <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Visible-Learning/dp/B07SR5D29D/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DM52P3XHBU14&amp;keywords=visible+learning&amp;qid=1680383890&amp;sprefix=visible+learnin%2Caps%2C178&amp;sr=8-3">0.5 standard deviations</a> , a far cry from the two sigma Bloom sought, this is still a relatively strong effect.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0040373">Blind Variation and Selective Retentions in Creative Thought as in Other Knowledge Processes</a> by Donald Campbell</h2><p> Drawing on an analogy to biological evolution, Campbell argues that randomness is an overlooked variable in learning and creative thinking.</p><p> He argues that all knowledge generation proceeds by:</p><ol><li> <strong>A trial-and-error process to induce some knowledge about the world.</strong> As with evolution, we try things out and retain what works.</li><li> <strong>Using previously-acquired knowledge instead of guessing.</strong> Once you uncover valid knowledge using the first process, you can apply it without the need for random guessing.</li><li> <strong>Even applying previously-acquired knowledge, there is variation and randomness generating further possibilities.</strong></li></ol><p> This suggests that much of what we associate with inventive creativity is simply (a) acquiring the relevant set of knowledge associated with the field and then (b) trying out lots of things and keeping what works.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00461528209529247">Antagonism Between Achievement and Enjoyment in ATI Studies</a> by Richard Clark</h2><p> Aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI) are when the same learning technique elicits different effects in students with different prior abilities.</p><p> A common finding in ATI studies is that low-ability students learn much better with highly-structured approaches, whereas higher-ability students benefit from less-structured environments. One explanation seems to be that if you lack the necessary knowledge and skills, guidance ensures you learn the material correctly. Still, if you already have them, then challenging, open-ended environments give you needed practice applying what you know.</p><p> It would seem reasonable to expect students to opt for the method of learning that works best for them. Low-ability students would recognize their difficulties and seek structure; high-ability students would try more challenging assignments.</p><p> Except when Clark reviewed the ATI literature, he found the opposite. Students tend to prefer the method that works less well for them, often unaware that it hinders their achievement. One explanation is that learning is effortful, and we enjoy learning methods that seem to save us effort.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.102.2.211">Long-Term Working Memory</a> by Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch</h2><p> Few concepts are as central to the science of learning as working memory. Our mental bandwidth is limited, and we can only keep in mind a few things at a time.</p><p> Given that we can only hold a few things in memory at once, how do we perform complex tasks?</p><p> One theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> . Through experience, we learn to recognize whole patterns of information as a single unit, allowing us to keep more in our heads at once. Remembering a random seven-digit number is hard, but we easily recall our phone number.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch review evidence that suggests chunking is insufficient to explain expert performance. For example, experts seem strangely impervious to interruptions. When reading a story rife with distractor sentences, comprehension of the story itself remains largely intact. This starkly contrasts with typical memory experiments, where distractors can completely wipe out memory for a task.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch argue that as we gain skill in an activity, we get better at using our long-term memories as a form of working memory, effectively expanding our capacity for familiar tasks.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fcdev.12272">Does Learning to Read Improve Intelligence</a> by Stuart Ritchie, Timothy Bates and Robert Plomin</h2><p> Keith Stanovich was among the first to propose that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">reading ability could bootstrap intelligence</a> .

In this experiment, the researchers encouraged students to explain what they were learning. They found that engaging in explanation tended to increase students&#39; understanding of the material.</p><p> My preferred explanation for this effect is attention. When reading an explanation, you generally don&#39;t have much motivation to test whether or not you understand it. In contrast, when generating an explanation, you get clear feedback about what you know and what you don&#39;t. This feedback returns your attention to the source material or problem to work out what is missing, resulting in a richer understanding than if you had stuck to the reading alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/">Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reader Request: How Should I Use ChatGPT to Learn Better?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 03 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15023 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Have you been using ChatGPT in your learning efforts?

But I was enthralled—both by the amount of work that has been done on figuring out how people learn to read (and the best way to teach them) and by what it implies for learning other skills.</p><p> Fluent readers can comprehend text at a rate of several words per second. Given this, it&#39;s easy to believe that we skim over words, infer the text by its likely context or don&#39;t pay attention to the letters. Fascinatingly, studies show that this isn&#39;t the case: good readers fixate on nearly every word in a sentence and seem to pay attention to nearly every letter in each word.</p><p> We manage to do this because the sound-spelling patterns are so thoroughly overlearned that unconscious neural networks, acting simultaneously, perform the cognitive “work” of decoding text.</p><p> In light of this, Adams argues that the best way to learn to read is, first, to learn systematically the basic sound-spelling combinations in language (ie, phonics), and second, to engage in lots and lots of reading where attention is focused on the sequence of letters to identify words.</p><p> I may eventually do a fuller write-up of Adams&#39;s book, as it contains a lot of nuggets for thinking about other skills that haven&#39;t been researched as thoroughly as learning to read.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Learning-Theory-Albert-Bandura/dp/0138167443">Social Learning Theory</a> by Albert Bandura</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Learning-Theory-Albert-Bandura/dp/0138167443"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL-205x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15008" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL-205x300.jpg 205w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL.jpg 342w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></a></figure></div><p> In this psychology classic, Albert Bandura introduced the idea of self-efficacy to studies of motivation.</p><p> Many early theories of motivation focused on expected benefits. If I thought the likely outcome of action X would be good for me, I&#39;d feel motivated to do X. In contrast, if X involved risk or harm, I&#39;d feel averse to taking that action.</p><p> Yet these theories seem ill-equipped to explain the diversity of motivation we see in practice. Why do some students study hard for a test while others slack? Moreover, why do we fail to motivate ourselves to do things we readily understand are in our self-interest?</p><p> Bandura argued that it wasn&#39;t merely our sense of the presumed benefits of taking an action, but also our beliefs about our ability to take that action, that influenced our motivation. A student who thinks she can&#39;t pass, no matter how hard she studies, won&#39;t be motivated—even if the cost of failure is high.</p><p> We gain self-efficacy for specific actions by seeing them done by others or, better yet, succeeding with them ourselves. Mastery experiences can become a reinforcing cycle, as experiencing success leads to greater self-efficacy and motivation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analyses-Achievement/dp/0415476186">Visible Learning</a> by John Hattie</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analyses-Achievement/dp/0415476186"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-212x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15010" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-212x300.jpg 212w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-724x1024.jpg 724w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-1086x1536.jpg 1086w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-1448x2048.jpg 1448w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL.jpg 1810w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></figure></div><p> What works in education? Unfortunately, the answer is seemingly everything. Every pet theory and learning technique has some supporter, armed with a study showing how well it works. But when everything works, what should you focus on?</p><p> One way around this quagmire is through meta-analyses. This technique groups together many studies to find the average effect of an intervention. Hattie&#39;s book goes even further, compiling 800 different meta-analyses in education to see a bird&#39;s-eye view of what works well for learning.</p><p> Hattie concludes that feedback plays a central role: not just the feedback of correcting students&#39; mistakes, but feedback to the teacher on what students are learning and failing to grasp. Mastery learning, direct instruction and reciprocal teaching fare well in Hattie&#39;s analysis.</p><p> This was my second time through Hattie&#39;s book, and I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be my last.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Creativity-Robert-J-Sternberg/dp/0521576040">The Handbook of Creativity</a> edited by Robert Sternberg</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Creativity-Robert-J-Sternberg/dp/0521576040"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15011" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL.jpg 907w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></figure></div><p> Creativity is one of our most mythologized abilities. It&#39;s also one of the most poorly understood.</p><p> I found this book useful for comparing different perspectives on creativity, including the role of expertise, chance, social environment and personality traits in what results in creative thinking.</p><p> The gist I get from reading these different perspectives is that creativity is a combination of:</p><ol><li> <strong>Individual problem-solving ability.</strong> Like routine problem-solving, this is a process of applying previous knowledge to generate new options.</li><li> <strong>Social recognition.</strong> Whether something is “creative” is a judgement based on prevailing opinions rather than an intrinsic trait of the thing itself.</li><li> <strong>Risk-taking and randomness.</strong> A “creative” vs. “routine” expert might be distinguished by the former&#39;s willingness to bet big on risks.</li></ol><p> Creativity is not a “skill” in this view. It&#39;s not something you can practice or learn how to do. Instead, it&#39;s a by-product of acquired expertise and a willingness to take intellectual risks.</p><p> Thus, the best way to be more creative is to learn a lot and take a lot of swings.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Mastery-Learning-Thomas-Guskey/dp/1071851004">Implementing Mastery Learning</a> by Thomas Guskey</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Mastery-Learning-Thomas-Guskey/dp/1071851004"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-791x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15012" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-232x300.jpg 232w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-768x994.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-1582x2048.jpg 1582w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L.jpg 1978w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /></a></figure></div><p> Mastery learning is one of the more effective pedagogical techniques for achievement, with powerful effects among weaker students.</p><p> The basic idea is simple: students are given lots of interim tests that don&#39;t count for grades.

Learning in this stage involves trying to apply instructions or explanations in practice.</li><li> <strong>Associative.</strong> Here, you&#39;re practicing on your own and trying to eliminate major errors.</li><li> <strong>Automatic.</strong> Finally, skills recede from conscious awareness as the mechanism for executing them relies less and less on our working memory systems.</li></ol><p> Automaticity has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> The advantage is that it frees up resources to do other things. For skills like reading or driving, this can be essential. If you can&#39;t automatically recognize words or manipulate the steering wheel, additional tasks, like analyzing a text or finding your way in a new city, are nearly impossible.</p><p> The disadvantage is that, being automated, skills overlearned to this point are very difficult to change or correct. Anders Ericsson proposed that much of becoming a world-class expert was engaging in practice efforts that work to undo some of the effects of this skill automation, using drills that bring awareness of the skill back under effortful control.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/">Recent Reading: Creativity, Mastery and the Three Phases of Learning</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are We Losing the Ability to Read Books?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 21 Mar 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=14994 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A Gallup poll shows we&#39;re reading fewer books each year.

US adults are reading roughly two or three fewer books per year than they did between 2001 and 2016.</p><p> …</p><p> The decline is greater among subgroups that tended to be more avid readers, particularly college graduates but also women and older Americans. College graduates read an average of about six fewer books in 2021 than they did between 2002 and 2016, 14.6 versus 21.1.</p></blockquote><p> This is a worrying trend.</p><p> It&#39;s possible, of course, to read fewer books and still engage in deep thinking. You can watch university classes on YouTube and read scientific papers online. Wikipedia does more than paper encyclopedias could have ever accomplished.</p><p> Yet books still represent the best format for deep, sustained engagement with an idea or story. A decline in reading books does not necessarily mean a loss of depth in every case, but it probably indicates a trend toward more shallow engagement on average.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Has Reading Books Declined?</h2><p> The poll did not analyze the cause of the decline. However, a likely explanation is that this decline closely tracks the rise of social media and smartphones. Reading books is a leisure activity that struggles to compete with the algorithmic engineering underlying most online content. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/choose.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> Anecdotally, this fits with many conversations I have had. Many people who used to pick up a book during their spare time now pick up their phone instead.</p><p> Reading books is both a skill and a habit. As an acquired skill, reading is initially effortful but becomes easier as we become fluent, recognizing words and building background knowledge of the matters discussed. As a habit, reading is something we choose to do (or not) in our moments of downtime.</p><p> But both skills and habits can atrophy <strong>.</strong> If you spend less time reading, it takes more effort to work through challenging texts. If you decide to read less often, choosing to read becomes more effortful. Reading books, and the opposite, can both become self-reinforcing actions—readers read more books, while nonreaders find it increasingly hard to do so.</p><p> Given this state of affairs, it&#39;s alarming that book reading is waning. Even if articles like this one act as a partial substitute, the skills and habits needed to engage deeply with ideas may still be declining. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">Curating our media consumption</a> may be necessary if we want to be the exception.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/">Are We Losing the Ability to Read Books?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What Would You Do With More Time?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/11/more-time/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/11/more-time/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 11 Mar 2023 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=14975 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Suppose you could add an extra two hours to every day: what would you do with your time?

Or simply give yourself more time to relax?</p><p> In imagining how you&#39;d spend an extra two hours, magically grafted onto each day, pay attention to what you don&#39;t add. You probably wouldn&#39;t add another meeting at the office or extra emails to respond to. I doubt you&#39;d add more time spent browsing on your phone.</p><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1467847972&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14976" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LOF-L4-more-time.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Yet, for most of us, we already spend far more than two hours per day on activities we wouldn&#39;t add in if more time had been gifted to us.</p><p> We&#39;ve already gone some way to explain this seeming contradiction:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/05/needing-attention/">Our attention is under the sway of powerful instincts</a> developed for a different environment than we live in.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/07/sustainable-productivity/">We equate productivity with effortful exertion</a> , mistaking the feeling of busyness for actually spending time on things that matter.</li><li> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/09/time-log/">We don&#39;t know where our time actually goes</a> , so we can lie to ourselves about how much of it is on activities we don&#39;t care about.</li></ul><p> Cultivating a life of focus requires creating deliberate systems to turn back some of these forces.

When creating Life of Focus, <a href="http://www.calnewport.com">Cal Newport</a> and I were motivated to provide structure, accountability and an opportunity to work on building these systems. There is no overnight fix. That&#39;s why the program runs for three months, as we slowly build up new habits.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> On Monday, we&#39;ll reopen <a href="http://www.life-of-focus-course.com">Life of Focus</a> for a new session.
