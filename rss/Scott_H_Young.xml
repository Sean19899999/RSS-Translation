Ignorance、Language Learning、Flashcards and More</a>帖子首先出现在<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>上周，我要求<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/newsletter/">时事通讯</a>的读者向我发送他们有关生活和学习的问题。您提出了很多很棒的问题！今天我挑选了一些最有趣/最有用的问题来回答。</p><p>读者的问题用引号括起来，我的回答则没有。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>计算器的出现减少了几代人对心算的依赖，而且这种情况还将持续下去。计算机和互联网时代使研究变得容易。因为我们有像位智这样的应用程序，所以我们不必费心去学习如何导航到某个地方。现在人工智能已经出现了。</p><p>我知道技术专家会证明技术可以而且将会被用来让我们变得更好，但我不禁想知道，考虑到人工智能特别能让我们作为学习者变得“软弱”，我们面临着巨大的风险。让 ChatGPT 为您和许多人做您的“思考”实在是太容易了，这可能已经足够好了。你怎么认为？</p><p> <cite>-基斯莱</cite></p></blockquote><p>对此我有两个想法。首先，每当人们担心新技术会让我们精神变弱时，我总是会想起苏格拉底，他谴责书写的传播破坏了记忆能力。而且，你知道吗——他是对的！古希腊人有<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">奇妙的记忆演讲和诗歌的系统</a>，但我们今天很少使用。</p><p>但更广泛的一点是，随着新技术使一些认知功能自动化，它为不同的功能开辟了空间。书籍可能会让背诵演讲变得不那么重要，但它们也极大地扩展了一个人可以获得的知识的广度和深度。</p><p>十几岁的时候，我记得读过有关谷歌和维基百科对我们学习能力产生有害影响的思考文章。但这些东西非常适合学习！我现在几乎可以立即了解几乎任何主题。我最近想通过一篇论文了解更多有关职业倦怠的科学知识，并立即获得了<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout">维基百科最新研究的摘要</a>。这是自我青春期以来的一个重大进步，更不用说那些不得不依赖纸质百科全书的几代人了。</p><p>因此，与其他人相比，我不太担心人工智能会破坏教育。</p><p>然而，我的第二个想法是，有时这种现成知识的巨大增长会鼓励人们提出相反的建议：由于这些技术，我们不需要学习东西。我确实认为某些技能可能会过时，但不是全部。计算器消除了计算尺的需要，但我们仍然需要了解算术才能使用计算器。学习知识需要知识，所以我对法学硕士或 ChatGPT 会减少教育需求的说法非常怀疑。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>有人声称可以提高阅读速度，两三天就能读完一本书。您对此有何看法？</p><p> <cite>-标记</cite></p></blockquote><p>我<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/01/19/speed-reading-redo/">在这里</a>介绍了有关快速阅读的研究。剧透警告：快速阅读只是一种策略性的略读。它可能对某些事情有帮助，但荒谬的速度总是会导致理解力下降。</p><p>但我也可以说我经常在两到三天内阅读书籍，我认为你不需要快速阅读。阅读大量书籍很大程度上就是坐下来连续阅读足够的时间来读完它。同样，你不需要成为一个快速电视观看者来在周末狂看整个 Netflix 系列……你只需要看很多电视就可以了。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您认为 SRS（间隔重复系统）对于学习历史有多重要？</p><p>我正在尝试阅读不同时期的书籍，但我发现自己陷入了两个极端：1）没有足够的背景知识来阅读我正在阅读的书籍，2）浪费时间创建和审查基本但过于分离的抽认卡从他们的主题，例如凯撒的出生年份/死亡或希腊的斯巴达/底比斯的位置。</p><p>更明智的方法是否是先让自己沉浸在儿童/青少年历史读物中，以获得对历史故事的直觉，然后再深入研究 SRS 来了解特定事物（如果有的话）？此外，您是否建议将任何内容放入 SRS 中以记录历史？</p><p> <cite>-最大限度</cite></p></blockquote><p>对于你想要非正式地理解的广泛的、以知识为基础的科目（即，不是试图通过特定的考试或获得奖学金），我认为你能做的最好的事情就是大量阅读。知识产生知识。你读得越多，你拥有的背景知识就越多，这使得进一步阅读变得更容易。</p><p>完成一个密集或复杂的领域通常是一个阅读某些内容的过程，保留其中的百分之十，阅读另一件事和另一件事，然后回到第一件事，因为突然间，你读到的东西以完全不同的方式显示了第一件事。光。最终，曾经的空白变成了事实细节、不同学者的观点以及复杂的学究式争论，而这些都是你在出发时无法理解的。</p><p>如果抽认卡妨碍了大量阅读，它们可能就是浪费时间。在某个领域内阅读更多内容可以为您提供新信息，并且通过上下文关联巧妙地强化旧信息。</p><p>话虽这么说，抽认卡对于某些特定目的来说是一个很好的工具。如果我参加的课程需要记住某些日期、数字或地点，我会使用它们。同样，如果我需要记住通过广泛阅读方法需要很长时间才能掌握的信息（例如，记住古代领土的地图），我可能会使用它们。最后，每当我需要提高更复杂过程的组成技能时，我都会使用它们——这就是抽认卡对于语言学习如此有效的原因；它们有助于减轻认知负荷。</p><p>但是，对于像历史这样的广泛主题，您可能最好从大量阅读开始，然后仅使用抽认卡来解决仅阅读无法解决的特定弱点。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>显然，我的智商略高于平均水平，但是伙计，当我在对话等中交谈时，我很难记住名字之类的东西。关于如何更容易记住的任何建议？例如，如果我用抽认卡学习，我就能长期记住事情，但在一次会议中听到某件事或看到一次通常是不同的（就像一只耳朵里和另一只耳朵里一样）。</p><p> <cite>-缺口</cite></p></blockquote><p>有一些<a href="https://eileenpease.com/how-to-remember-names/">记忆名字的助记技巧</a>。</p><p>但我认为我们倾向于不保留名字，因为当人们自我介绍时我们通常不会太注意它们。我们听到有人说：“嗨，我是汤姆”，承认汤姆确实是一个人名，然后立即专注于我们想谈论的其他内容。</p><p>你可以通过在别人说名字时多加注意来记住名字和其他任何东西。使用一个人的名字，将他们的名字与另一个同名的人联系起来，甚至只是停下来在心里排练几秒钟通常就足够了。</p><p>大多数时候，我们之所以不容易记住某件事，是因为我们第一次遇到它时没有给予足够的关注。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我知道 60 岁以后的成年人在学习新事物或重新学习 30 多年前放弃的乐器时会面临不同的挑战。关于老年人的学习，你了解多少？而且，您会推荐哪些书籍来提供经过验证的高级学习策略，甚至可能深入研究神经生物学和/或神经可塑性？</p><p> <cite>-莉兹</cite></p></blockquote><p>我<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/02/24/age-learning/">在这篇文章中</a>介绍了有关学习和衰老的研究。</p><p>然而，我从这项研究中得到的主要收获是，大脑是身体的一部分。为了维持心理功能，你能做的最好的事情就是保持身体健康。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>接触大量信息（新闻、广播、谈话、阅读、社交媒体等）是否会降低您的学习能力？</p><p> <cite>-海登</cite></p></blockquote><p>直接回答这个问题，我想答案显然是否定的。背景知识是未来学习的最佳决定因素之一。因此，在很多方面，答案是相反的：接触大量信息<em>可以提高</em>你的学习能力。</p><p>然而，我怀疑海登可能想表达的是，拥有大量信息是否会分散注意力，让你更难集中精力学习学术知识。我认为这可能是真的，这就是为什么在学习时排除干扰并<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">有意识地选择在线媒体消费</a>会有所帮助的原因之一。</p><p>但总的来说，接触信息的广泛影响是积极的。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>材料的复杂性如何影响你在间隔检索练习中如何将其间隔开？</p><p> <cite>-伊万</cite></p></blockquote><p>复杂性可能有利于<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196276">集中实践，至少在最初是这样</a>。如果你第一次遇到某件事时不明白，那么间隔会让最初的学习变得更加困难。这可能适用于所有<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/03/15/desirable-difficulties/">理想的困难</a>，这也是大多数练习类型都涉及初始集中会议的部分原因，您可以在其中“获得”想法，然后进行间隔复习。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>我是你的书<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">《Ultralearning》</a>的忠实粉丝。如果您今天要重新编写超级学习（或者今天有兴趣开始非常不同的新超级学习项目），您会采取哪些不同的做法？您会改变您的 9 项原则或通过截然不同的项目来实现超级学习吗？</p><p> <cite>-凯</cite></p></blockquote><p>如果我必须重写 Ultralearning，我只会做一些微小的改变。</p><p>我会更严格地区分实践和解决问题。当我写《Ultralearning》时，我没有思维模型来区分这种区别，但我现在认为这是学习时更重要的区别之一。 （特别是，使用斯里尼瓦萨·拉马努金（Srinivasa Ramanujan）的数学学习努力作为检索练习的例子混淆了这种区别，所以如果我必须重写，我不会使用这个故事。）</p><p>我认为最重要的是，与我撰写《超学习》时相比，我现在对学习理论及其证据基础有了更广泛的了解，因此我即将出版的书将更加以这些理论为基础。但实际上，我不确定我会改变太多的建议。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>有一段时间，我在工作中感觉似曾相识。我在学习与发展领域已经工作了 15 年多，但我越来越觉得没有什么新的东西即将出现。例如，学习项目的游戏化一直是一个回归的主题，但同时也是一个回归的失望。与模拟、谈话、解释、“学习经验”相同......</p><p>技术不断发展，但其使用方式却不断重复。学习中的趋势是周期性的。您同意这一观察吗？我越来越觉得技术并没有带来多大的改变——主要是新奇的效果。当它消失后，人们发现你无法“破解”或“加速”人类的学习过程。你怎么认为？</p><p> <cite>-伊尔瑟</cite></p></blockquote><p>我认为人类大脑的设计对学习设置了一些我们无法通过技术克服的基本限制（缺乏某种科幻小说中的直接大脑重新布线）。你是对的，对于特定的方法论经常有过度的炒作，而随着人们意识到其局限性，这种炒作往往会消失。</p><p>但是，我倾向于更加乐观。大多数人都可以学习，但也有很多人很难做到。我不认为有什么革命性的方法可以解决这些人的问题，但我确实认为更好地了解大脑如何工作、学习如何工作以及我们如何帮助人们可以解决其中一些困难。</p><p>但是，实际上，如果你需要学习一门语言，你就必须学习所有的单词。那些提供以某种方式跳过学习单词的技巧的人只是在夸夸其谈。不幸的是，大多数学习都是这样的——你需要学习单词。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>作为一名大学教师，我认为表现最好的学生是那些对学科最感兴趣的学生。然而，似乎对某一学科最感兴趣的学生是那些最聪明的学生。</p><p>智力只是对思考的兴趣，还是那些聪明的人对复杂的事物感兴趣而对简单的事物感到厌倦？</p><p> <cite>——格雷厄姆</cite></p></blockquote><p>我的观点是好奇心会复合。你拥有的知识越多（聪明的人往往拥有更多的知识，因为他们一生中更容易学习），你发现特定主题就越有趣。</p><p>因此，更聪明（知识更丰富）的学生会发现这些主题更有趣，因为他们的背景知识使他们更容易理解传入的想法并提出有趣的问题。</p><p>至于如何激发无聊学生的兴趣，我不确定是否有什么神奇的秘诀。然而，我确实认为认识到许多学生因为对这个主题了解不够而不感兴趣，确实指出了一些有用的方向。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您曾经说过，学生应该把大部分时间花在自我测试上，而不仅仅是复习材料。</p><p>在学习外语的过程中，阅读外语算不算考验自己？</p><p> <cite>-约翰</cite></p></blockquote><p>出于其他原因，大量阅读一种语言很重要，但它也可以算作一种检索练习。本质上，每当你收到输入时，你都是在练习“目标语言”->;“意义”，就像你在说话时练习“意义”->;“目标语言”一样。两者都是一种检索，而并排查看词汇表则不是。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>如果没有朋友加入，你会如何改变<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">“没有英语的一年”</a> ？</p><p>自从你开始我就想做这个挑战，但一直没能说服朋友加入我。我最接近独自完成这个任务是在 2020 年 2 月：我辞掉了工作，带着很多积蓄去环游世界，而新冠疫情彻底终结了我的梦想。我希望在 2025 年再次尝试这一点，因为我目前在军队，但我担心如果没有朋友/同伴，挑战不会那么有趣。</p><p> <cite>-肖恩</cite></p></blockquote><p>我认为你必须更加谨慎地寻找练习机会。</p><p>此外，我会积极寻找寄宿家庭或与来自该国的人一起上学的机会，以沉浸在这门语言中。</p><p>我姐姐在高中最后一年参加了<a href="https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/youth-exchanges">扶轮</a>社交流，并与一个丹麦家庭住在一起，她的丹麦语学得很好。在某些方面，这比与另一个非母语人士一起旅行学习语言“更好”。</p><p>就乐趣而言，我更喜欢与另一个人一起旅行，但<a href="http://fluentinthreemonths.com/">本尼·刘易斯 (Benny Lewis)</a>的大部分语言学习冒险都是独自完成的，所以我认为这取决于人。如果你认为自己是一个比较内向的人，或者交朋友的速度不那么快，我建议你少走动，因为你可能需要更长的时间才能建立一个良好的朋友圈。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> <strong>Q-1：</strong> Anki 单独工作吗？或者我们是否需要将它与阅读和听力（或其他）一起使用？</p><p> <strong>Q-2：</strong>我知道在西班牙语中，名词有性别。你如何学习名词的性别，以及如何在对话中学会流畅地使用它（在你与本尼用西班牙语进行的最后一次对话中，你似乎流利且自动地说话）？</p><p> <cite>-帕维尔</cite></p></blockquote><p>Anki 是一个很好的基础。但真实的输入和输出对于正确使用语言至关重要。我的观点是，记住抽认卡可以更容易地理解一些段落，因此它有助于“真正的”练习，但不能取代它。</p><p>对于学习性别，其中一些是通过定期练习自动学习的。你可以直接把它放在你的抽认卡上（我知道有些人用颜色编码来表示难以记住的词汇特征，如性别、声调等）。但是，定期聆听或使用该语言也会让您反复听到的单词的“正确”性别感觉更自然。更不用说像西班牙语这样的语言具有相当透明的性别系统，因此随着您知识的扩展，猜测新单词会变得更加容易。</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>问：</strong>您是否考虑过为自己创建一个法学硕士导师版本，接受您所有文章和您制作的其他免费内容资源的培训？</p><p> <cite>-仁</cite></p></blockquote><p>我什至不确定我是否能很好地模拟自己，所以我真的不相信人工智能能做好工作！</p><p> _ _

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>语言学习是一个我很关心的话题。没有什么比用一种直到最近你还无法理解的语言与某人交谈更令人兴奋的了。但是，尽管当你学对语言时会令人兴奋，但学习一门语言也可能充满挫败感、误解和令人尴尬的错误。</p><p>我学习语言的大部分知识都来自第一手经验。在大学期间，我在国外学习法语的日子很坎坷。后来，我和朋友一起旅行时，<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">在一年内学习了四种不同的语言，</a>有了更好的体验。</p><p>尽管进行了多年的自我实验，我还没有仔细研究过哪些内容在语言学习中有效，哪些无效。最近，我决定开始通过阅读一些有关第二语言习得科学的书籍来解决这个问题。最好的是 Patsy Lightbown 和 Nina Spada 的<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/How-Languages-are-Learned-4th-ebook/dp/B00BHHIYBC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1683654053&amp;sr=8-2">《语言是如何学习的</a>》。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">评估六种不同的语言学习方法</h2><p>Lightbown 和 Spada 的书是作为第二语言教师的培训指南，涵盖了广泛的语言习得研究。我发现这一章总结了六种流行的方法以及支持和反对它们的证据，这非常有趣。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1、准确第一。 </h3><figure

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-lingual_method">音频语言方法</a>试图用呼叫和响应格式取代这种基于文本的方法。在这种新方法中，学生通过严格遵循老师的示例来产生正确的句子。通过从一开始就正确地教授这些模式，就不会养成不良的说话习惯。</p><p>准确性第一的方法长期以来在课堂上很流行。但在研究人员中，他们失宠了，因为他们的一些基本假设开始受到质疑：</p><ul><li><strong>大多数语言的使用并不是严格意义上的模仿</strong>——我们会生成新的句子来表达我们的意思。听说方法的大量重复可能并不能反映我们如何获得真正的语言。</li><li><strong>语言（包括第二语言）是按照发展时间表出现的。</strong>无论教学方式如何，学生似乎都会按照固定的顺序学习某些语法模式。这表明避免所有错误实际上是不可能的。</li><li><strong>课堂学习与自发语言使用有着微妙的关系。</strong>书中提到了一项研究，在该研究中，被积极教授某种特定模式的学生确实更多地使用了该模式，但在其他句子中也犯了更多错误！</li></ul><p>然而，也许最重要的是，诺姆·乔姆斯基对 BF Skinner 对语言的行为主义解释的<a href="https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/1148/1/chomsky.htm">毁灭性打击</a>鼓励研究人员到其他地方寻找新方法。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 只需输入即可。 </h3><figure

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">输入假设</a>提出，语法练习和重复练习除了效率低下之外，在产生真正的语言习得方面也完全无效。</p><p>相反，克拉申的理论认为，你只需要可理解的输入来学习语言。在这里，输入是指你听或读的语言的含义，而不是试图分析其语法。因此，您为了理解而阅读的书籍、路标或对话都将被输入。你从课本上抄来的句子却不是。</p><p>基于输入的方法有其吸引力：练习并不是特别有趣，演讲机会可能稀缺且压力很大，但书籍和录音随处可见。一项研究甚至发现，在基于输入的课堂上学习两年后，学生的表现与传统课堂上的学生一样好（甚至更好），包括在口语方面的表现——尽管他们从未练习过。</p><p>然而，一些研究反驳了克拉申假说的一些更大胆的主张。对拥有大量语言输入的法语沉浸式学生的研究发现，尽管他们的理解能力达到了母语水平，但尽管经过多年的全日制沉浸式学习，他们在说话时仍然会犯非母语语法错误。学生似乎确实受益于对语言形式和规则的明确指导。</p><h3

的输入假说，认为表达更复杂想法的需要可能是语言学习的驱动力。同样，迈克尔·朗的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_hypothesis">互动假说</a>认为，互动（而不仅仅是输入）对于学习至关重要。</p><p>基于交互的方法的优点之一是，对话伙伴可以自然地调整他们的沟通水平，以便学生能够理解。相比之下，书籍或录音是固定的，因此必须找到适当难度的材料。</p><p>另一个优点是，真正的交流可以让学生假设语言是如何运作的，并根据他们的成功获得即时反馈。相反，只强调输入或练习的方法不允许这种实验。</p><p>然而，纯粹的互动方法，缺乏语法指导，可能会更难养成正确的说话习惯。当对话伙伴的意思被理解时，对话伙伴通常不会纠正错误，并且当他们的错误话语被正确地重复给他们时，许多学生不会使用更微妙的反馈形式。</p><h3

Write what you like to read. There are no rules in writing other than this.</strong></p><p> It can take some reflection to figure out what kind of writing you like. First impressions can be misleading. I&#39;ve done exercises where I study writing I like. Often, what I thought I liked about a piece of writing turns out not to be there at all.

But to appreciate the theory, we need to step back and take a look at an earlier, simpler theory of motivation that self-efficacy was intended to correct.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Rational Expectations: Motivation for Robots</h2><p> Rational expectations was a prominent theory of motivation, independently proposed by both Edward Tolman and Kurt Lewin in the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p> It proposes that our subjective feeling of motivation is an unconscious calculation of the benefits and costs we&#39;d experience from taking an action. Put mathematically:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p class="has-text-align-center"> <strong>Motivation = Benefits x Probability – Costs</strong> </p></blockquote><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15497" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robot-self-efficacy.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> To use a concrete example, according to rational expectations, the motivation I feel for exercising would come from the benefit I expect to achieve (getting in shape), multiplied by the chance that exercising leads to that benefit, minus the costs of effort of sticking to my fitness program.</p><p> As implied by its name, rational expectations are, well, rational. This theory suggests that whenever we don&#39;t feel motivated, it&#39;s simply because we&#39;ve judged another option to be more valuable for us. Accordingly, if we failed to exercise and sat around watching Netflix instead, we valued keeping up on our shows more than having a beach body. No mystery at all.</p><p> Rational expectations isn&#39;t a terrible theory—it&#39;s probably a pretty good approximation of why we&#39;re motivated in many cases. But it&#39;s also the kind of motivational theory we&#39;d expect of a robot, rather than a human being—it assumes we perfectly weigh the options and always make the right choice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Motivation for Humans: Self-Efficacy Intervenes</h2><p> Albert Bandura theorized that what was missing from rational expectations was an intervening step. It isn&#39;t enough to have expectations about the outcomes of our actions; we must also have expectations about our ability <em>to take</em> those actions.</p><p> Consider our exercising example again. Bandura argued it isn&#39;t enough to look at our expectations about outcomes (the chance that exercising will improve our fitness). We must also examine our expectations about our ability to take action (whether we believe we can stick to our exercise program). The former may be high enough to justify the cost, but we&#39;ll be stuck with low motivation if the latter is low.</p><p> Bandura articulated it in the following way: </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15496" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Self-efficacy-diagram.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> <strong>Self-efficacy helps to explain why, even when we want an outcome, we might not work toward it:</strong></p><ul><li> It&#39;s not just our desire to graduate, but our belief that we are capable of learning the material.</li><li> It&#39;s not just our desire to own a business, but our belief that we can make it successful.</li><li> It&#39;s not just our desire to have a relationship, but our belief that we can ask someone out without being rejected.</li></ul><p> Bandura&#39;s theory improved on rational expectations because it argued that wanting an outcome isn&#39;t enough to motivate you into action; you must also be confident in your ability to take the actions required to reach that outcome.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Common Confusions About Self-Efficacy</h2><p> Before I explain some of the implications of self-efficacy, I want to clarify what self-efficacy is not:</p><ul><li> <strong>Self-efficacy is not self-esteem.</strong> Self-esteem is how you value yourself. Self-efficacy is your belief that you can succeed in taking a particular course of action. You can believe you&#39;re wonderful while also believing you&#39;re incapable of learning quantum mechanics.</li><li> <strong>Self-efficacy is not self-concept.</strong> Self-concept is how you think about <em>yourself</em> . Self-efficacy is about how you think about <em>your ability to perform</em> a given set of actions.</li><li> <strong>Self-efficacy is not confidence.</strong> As Bandura explains, “Confidence is a nondescript term that refers to strength of belief but does not necessarily specify what the certainty is about. I can be supremely confident that I will fail at an endeavor.”</li></ul><p> Self-efficacy may be an academic theory, but we all have some experience with the concept. We can recall situations where we felt assured of our abilities, and others where we seriously doubted we could succeed. We know first-hand the consequences these beliefs had on our motivation.</p><p> Bandura&#39;s contribution goes beyond merely labeling this common experience and suggests important implications for understanding our motivation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Causes Self-Efficacy</h2><p> Bandura&#39;s research found that there are four major moderators for self-efficacy.</p><p> The first two were weak moderators—they could have small effects, but they weren&#39;t reliable:</p><ol><li> <strong>Bodily arousal.</strong> Think of the sweaty palms and racing heart that accompany stage fright or the queasiness that comes before a big exam. These can make it harder to perform, even if you otherwise would be able to in a relaxed state.</li><li> <strong>Verbal persuasion.</strong> The crowd cheering as you finish a race. A teacher telling you that you can do it. Simple affirmations that you can or can&#39;t do something can influence self-efficacy, but the impact is unreliable.</li></ol><p> In contrast to these weaker effects, Bandura identified two more consistent sources of self-efficacy:</p><ol><li> <strong>Vicarious experience.</strong> Witnessing someone perform the task increases self-efficacy. Firstly, this works by giving us a way to learn an effective strategy: If I watch someone solve a puzzle, I can copy their approach to get the same result. There is also a motivational piece: If I see another spider-phobic person touch a tarantula, I might gain courage to do so as well.</li><li> <strong>Personal mastery.</strong> Personally experiencing success with a task (or something like it) is the most powerful tool improving self-efficacy. I&#39;ll feel more confident I can run a marathon after I&#39;ve run a half-marathon. I&#39;ll feel more confident I can be a software developer after I&#39;ve aced my intro programming class.</li></ol><p> It&#39;s likely that people with strong self-efficacy, and thus, high degrees of motivation to work on ambitious goals, have had plenty of both vicarious and personal mastery experiences.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Non-Obvious Implications of Self-Efficacy</h2><p> While the feeling of self-efficacy is something we all know, the implications of the theory are not always obvious.</p><p> Here are a few important corollaries of the theory:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Motivation builds from success.</h3><p> Because personal mastery is crucial in building self-efficacy, a long string of failures at the beginning of an endeavor is more likely to demotivate than build grit.</p><p> Does this mean that the best way to motivate is to experience only success?不完全的。 As Bandura himself puts it:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Performance accomplishments provide the most dependable source of efficacy expectations because they are based on one&#39;s own personal experiences. Successes raise mastery expectations; repeated failures lower them, especially if mishaps occur early in the course of events. After strong efficacy expectations are developed through repeated success, the negative impact of occasional failures is likely to be reduced. Indeed occasional failures that are later overcome by determined effort can strengthen self-motivated persistence through experience that even the most difficult of obstacles can be mastered by sustained effort. The effects of failure on personal efficacy therefore partly depend on the timing and the total pattern of experiences in which they occur. Once established, efficacy expectancies tend to generalize to related situations.</p></blockquote><p> If you have low self-efficacy, it helps to build a foundation of success. Once you have established a basic level of confidence, mixing challenges with occasional setbacks helps make that self-efficacy more robust. You&#39;ll learn that you can succeed, even in the face of momentary difficulties.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. The confidence spiral can go up—or down.</h3><p> The mathematics of self-efficacy form a positive feedback loop. Consider:</p><ol><li> You have some self-efficacy, which enables you to take action and achieve a result.</li><li> Success from taking the action increases your self-efficacy.</li><li> Next time, you are more motivated to take the previous action.</li><li> Repeat.</li></ol><p> Eventually, your motivation would plateau at the level implied by the rational expectations theory (which is one reason why even some tasks we&#39;re supremely confident in, like washing dishes, don&#39;t inspire ecstatic motivation).</p><p> Conversely, motivation can also crash as we experience lowered self-efficacy:</p><ol><li> You have some self-efficacy, and take action, but you fail to follow up or fully complete the action.</li><li> Not achieving the desired result decreases your perceived self-efficacy.</li><li> Next time, you have less motivation to take the previous action.</li><li> Repeat.</li></ol><p> This motivation spiral plateaus at total inhibition to take the desired action. The effect is familiar to anyone who has tried a new pursuit a few times, stumbled, and then found it difficult or aversive to attack the problem again. Low self-efficacy can be a trap we stumble into. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15495" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chart-self-efficacy.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Learn from Others, Succeed Yourself.</h3><p> Self-efficacy was only a part of Bandura&#39;s broader social learning theory. In it, he argued that most of what we know comes from other people, and we learn how to do most things by witnessing the behavior of others—not through our own trial-and-error.</p><p> This suggests that a critical way to build self-efficacy is to closely study people who are successful in the pursuit you care about—see how they do it until you understand the actions they&#39;re taking and why. Their success isn&#39;t a mystery; it&#39;s a logical outcome of the series of decisions they have made and actions they have taken.</p><p> If you combine this careful study approach with taking the same actions yourself, you&#39;re using the two most powerful levers Bandura identified to increase your self-efficacy and, thus, your motivation for working on challenging goals.</p><p class="has-small-font-size"> Sources:<br /> Bandura, Albert. <em>Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control</em> .

Since I&#39;m now twice as old as I was when I started, I thought I&#39;d take some time to reflect on advice I wish I could have given my younger self. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15476" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Looking-ocean-18-life-lessons.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. You&#39;ll have more dating success if you strive to be relaxed rather than confident.</h4><p> Most dating advice for young men is terrible. One of the most misunderstood is the recommendation to “act confident.” Pretending to be confident when you&#39;re not usually makes you look like a jerk or a buffoon. In contrast, genuinely confident people tend to be relaxed.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Make friends with the exchange students.</h4><p> People who deliberately choose to live abroad for a year are more interesting, on average, than those who are closed to such experiences. Exchange students also tend to be looking to make friends. (This also is a good way to get more opportunities to apply lesson #3.)</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Say yes to invitations to visit a friend in their home country whenever possible.</h4><p> Being shown around by a local is vastly better than being a tourist. This is doubly true if you make friends with people from non-touristy places.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Learn how to cook.</h4><p> I spent too many years eating terrible food because I didn&#39;t know how to make good meals. The remedy is to find recipes online and follow them to the letter. Eventually you can improvise once you&#39;ve learned the basics.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. Optimize for experience, not grades, in college.</h4><p> My biggest mistake in university was choosing to take classes in English, not French, during my year abroad. I was worried I wouldn&#39;t keep up academically, so I chose the easier option. I didn&#39;t realize I was also missing out on the best way to learn the language.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. Go to more parties, but drink less.</h4><p> Drinking has strongly diminishing returns for enjoyment, and hangovers are not fun. Thus, if you&#39;re going to partake, pick a strict cutoff and stop when you hit that amount. You&#39;ll enjoy more parties with fewer headaches.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Learn to separate challenging situations from toxic ones, and don&#39;t feel guilty abandoning the latter.</h4><p> You won&#39;t regret sticking to hard challenges, but you&#39;ll regret burning yourself out in situations where your values don&#39;t align with what you&#39;re being asked to work on.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. Learn to recognize assholes and refuse to deal with them.</h4><p> Assholes often seem cool, successful or important. In the short term, it often feels like you should just put up with their personalities to further your goals. But in the long-term, you&#39;ll almost always regret not cutting them loose sooner.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. Never date a person you wouldn&#39;t also be friends with.</h4><p> It&#39;s easy to overlook personality differences when enthralled by a person&#39;s more superficial characteristics. But those relationships rarely work out. My wife and I, who have now been together for nine years, were just friends for eight years before that.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. Avoid premature optimization.</h4><p> When you&#39;re young and broke, a job that pays a lot of money (to you) can be very attractive. Unfortunately, if that job doesn&#39;t help you build skills you&#39;ll care about when you&#39;re middle-aged, you may be better off declining the opportunity for a lower-paying job that does. While you need money to live, resist the temptation to cash in early.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 11. It&#39;s okay to be (a little) weirder as an adult.</h4><p> High school enforces an unusually high degree of conformity. In high school, even “weird” kids tend to conform to a particular clique rather than be genuinely interesting. Outside of high school, however, there are fewer penalties for being a little different, and there is more potential upside as there is a larger pool of potential friends whose interests may overlap with yours.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 12. Don&#39;t waste your electives on “easy” classes.</h4><p> Depending on your major, you may only have a handful of classes that you can choose for yourself. Don&#39;t waste these! Take interesting classes from different departments rather than the easy-A class that teaches you Microsoft Word.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 13. Spend less time on your computer and more time at in-person events.</h4><p> It&#39;s even better if those events have nothing to do with your current friends or interests. Bulk-positive randomness is a powerful force, but it can&#39;t move you if you stay inside your dorm room.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 14. Ask yourself what a more extraverted version of you would do, and then do that.</h4><p> Introversion is great when you&#39;re settled into a job and family life. But when you&#39;re young, exploring the maximum possible options for your future is important, so striving to be a more extraverted version of yourself is generally desirable.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 15. Travel as much as you can.</h4><p> Yes, traveling can be expensive. But you&#39;ll never be able to travel as cheaply, or have as many interesting experiences, as you can when you&#39;re young.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 16. Press your clothes, comb your hair and wash your face.</h4><p> I&#39;ll admit my appearance has never been something I&#39;ve thought a lot about. But getting the basics right is usually not too onerous, and they matter a lot more for how people see you than how much money you spend on your clothes or how much you work out at the gym.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 17. Don&#39;t be so dogmatic.</h4><p> I&#39;ve softened in many ways as I&#39;ve gotten older. While youthful intensity about beliefs, goals or projects can be incredibly valuable, it can also get in the way of having new experiences. It&#39;s better to avoid being too rigid when you don&#39;t yet know which ideas of yours really ought to be inviolable.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> 18. Call your parents more often.</h4><p> Since becoming a father, I&#39;ve come to appreciate my own parents in a way that would have been difficult to understand as an eighteen-year-old. While it&#39;s easy to get absorbed in your own new experiences of adulthood, it&#39;s worth taking some time to keep up the relationships that have been with you all your life.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> What advice would you give your younger self?

During my eight years in college, I spent many <em>thousands</em> of hours reading about economics, politics, and philosophy. Since high school, I&#39;ve spent over ten thousand hours writing. When young people ask me, “How can I be like you?“ my first thought is, again, <strong><em>do ten times as much</em></strong> .</p><p> Ten times as much of what, exactly? The answer is usually: Whatever you already think the crucial ingredient is. “Why can&#39;t I get ahead in my career? I strive to study and emulate my role models.” Great idea; you just need to multiply your effort by a factor a ten. “How can I save my marriage? I&#39;m really trying to make my spouse happy.” Again, great idea. You just need to multiply your effort by a factor of ten.</p></blockquote><p> The 10x Rule has helped me personally.</p><p> When I was gearing up to promote my book, Ultralearning, I asked for advice from James Clear, author of the mega best-seller, <em>Atomic Habits</em> . I knew podcasts were important for promotion, but I figured a dozen would suffice.</p><p> I asked James how many podcasts he went on. He told me he recorded 80 before the book launched and 200-300 in the first six months after its release. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15450" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Ladder-ambitious-goal.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Doing ten times as much of what you think works doesn&#39;t sound like mind-blowing advice. But it&#39;s startling to me how often the solution to whatever life problem you&#39;re facing is simply doing more to solve it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Do the Obvious Thing First</h2><p> <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/dating-roundup-1-this-is-why-youre?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=573100&amp;post_id=136039060&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Zvi Mowshowitz writes about data collected on dating</a> from singles who want to be in a relationship. From this group, the most typical number of dates they had been on in the past year was <em>one</em> .</p><p> Zvi elaborates:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> I am not saying that dating is easy or that I found it to be easy. I will go ahead and say it is not once-a-year level hard for most people to find worthwhile first dates.</p><p> What I especially find curious is that one is the most popular response rather than zero. It would make sense to me that the answer is frequently zero dates, because you are not trying and aren&#39;t &#39;date ready&#39; in various senses. What&#39;s super weird is that the vast majority did go on the one first date, but mostly they didn&#39;t go on a second, and only half of those went on a third. It is as if people are capable of getting a date, then they go on one and recoil in &#39;oh no not that again&#39; horror for about a year, then repeat the cycle? Or their friends set them up every year or so because it&#39;s been too long, or something? None of that makes sense to me.</p></blockquote><p> If you&#39;re lonely and want to be in a relationship, the solution is obvious: get out, meet more people, ask them on dates and brush yourself off when you face rejection or heartbreak. Worrying about your height, weight, looks, or bank account is a distraction if you won&#39;t surmount the basic hurdle of putting yourself in more potentially-romantic contact with other people.</p><p> I could draw a similar lesson from my <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/the-year-without-english-2/">language learning experiences</a> : the best techniques don&#39;t matter if you&#39;re not using the language enough. The secret to Vat and my success with the No English Rule wasn&#39;t exceptional talent or some magic of immersion. It&#39;s because when you commit to only speaking in the language you&#39;re learning, you end up practicing 10x as much.</p><p> Becoming a better writer is another example. I occasionally get emails from people who have started new blogs and want critiques of their writing. Invariably, they&#39;ve written a handful of posts. I believe you shouldn&#39;t worry about technique until you&#39;ve written at least one hundred essays. If you&#39;re not doing that much, finessing the method is pointless. I was at least a thousand essays in before my writing career took off, and I suspect I&#39;m not an outlier.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Trick is Not Minding That It Hurts</h2><p> In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvQViPBAvPk">scene in Lawrence of Arabia</a> , the titular TE Lawrence lights a cigarette and puts out the match by rubbing it between his fingers. Shortly after, another man attempts the same trick:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Man: Oh! [burning his fingers] It damn well hurts!</p><p> Lawrence: Certainly it does.</p><p> Man: Well what&#39;s the trick then?</p><p> Lawrence: The trick, William Potter, is not <em>minding</em> that it hurts.</p></blockquote><p> The trick for most ambitious pursuits, I&#39;m afraid, is simply doing the obvious thing much, much more than most other people are willing to do—and not minding that it&#39;s hard at times.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/26/10x-rule-ambitious-goals/">The Simple Rule for Achieving Ambitious Goals</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/26/10x-rule-ambitious-goals/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Key to Building Rare and Valuable Skills</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/16/rare-valuable-skills/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/16/rare-valuable-skills/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 15:29:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15399 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> The three ingredients needed to apply deliberate practice to your career.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/16/rare-valuable-skills/">The Key to Building Rare and Valuable Skills</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> In the last three lessons, I&#39;ve discussed the importance of focusing on the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/">career capital that drives people&#39;s success</a> , the logic of supply and demand that explains <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/">why rare and valuable skills matter so much</a> , and the crucial importance of correctly identifying the path forward so you <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/14/before-burn-out/">don&#39;t burn yourself out working on the wrong things</a> .</p><p> Today, I&#39;d like to shift and talk about how you can get good at the skills you need to flourish in your career.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Anders Ericsson and the Legacy of Deliberate Practice</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1621518582&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> Few psychologists contributed more to the study of expertise than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a> . His work studying world-class performance began with a simple memory study.</p><p> Digit-span tasks have long been a staple in cognitive psychology research. These are simple tasks where a subject is presented with a list of numbers and then asked to recall as many as they can remember. A famous finding from this type of task is that most people can recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">between five and nine digits</a> .</p><p> Typically, subjects get little practice on this task. Ericsson, however, worked with a single subject and repeated the same task over many sessions.结果？ The subject&#39;s digit span exploded—he could recall over <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12562">100 digits</a> at the end of their long training sessions. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15400" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-4-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> In this particular subject&#39;s case, he invented a mnemonic system using running times (he was an avid runner) to recall far more digits than his memory would typically allow.</p><p> This experience led Ericsson to a long career studying the effects of large quantities of focused practice on human performance. Experts of all stripes, from doctors to musicians, can achieve things that would overwhelm the minds of novices through these sustained efforts.</p><p> Ericsson&#39;s research was a crucial inspiration for Cal Newport and me when we began working on <a href="https://www.top-performer-course.com">Top Performer</a> . Given the connection between world-class skills and an excellent career, we were interested in seeing how this model of deliberate practice could apply outside of the laboratory, tennis court, or music conservatory—how it could apply to professional areas where such practice efforts weren&#39;t the norm.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Applying Deliberate Practice to the Office</h2><p> There are three basic ingredients to acquire any complex skill:</p><ol><li> <strong>You need to understand how the skill works.</strong> This mostly comes from learning from other people&#39;s examples, so you&#39;re not reinventing the wheel and are using current best practices.</li><li> <strong>You need a lot of practice.</strong> Practice lets you perform skills more quickly and automatically. Ericsson&#39;s obsession with deliberate practice stemmed from the seeming removal of a hard psychological limit on human performance, just by practicing a lot.</li><li> <strong>You need corrective feedback.</strong> Understanding how a skill works and doing it a lot is generally insufficient to get extremely good—corrective feedback that identifies what you&#39;re doing wrong and offers a replacement is usually needed to continue to improve.</li></ol><p> Ericsson&#39;s definition of deliberate practice involves focused training sessions away from the demands of productive work. In these sessions, you would pay attention to a key aspect of your performance. Coaching would almost always be required because, otherwise, it&#39;s hard to get adequate corrective feedback.</p><p> Such a definition of deliberate practice makes a lot of sense in tightly controlled, high-performance domains such as chess, music or athletics. But what do you do to get better when your job is, as one former Top Performer student put it, “to basically answer emails all day?”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Designing a Deliberate Practice Project</h2><p> Professional skills in real environments are not the same as highly-controlled variables in laboratory studies. Thus, when building rare and valuable career skills, getting the exact kind of deliberate practice Ericsson identified as crucial for world-class skill development is often difficult.</p><p> At the same time, we need to avoid the trap of simply accumulating seniority if we want to accelerate our careers. Many practitioners, even ones with years of experience, aren&#39;t exceptionally proficient. Despite years of experience, their skills can stop progressing if they lack a suitable training environment.</p><p> Cal and my solution to this dilemma in <a href="http://www.top-performer-course.com">Top Performer</a> was to guide students in designing a deliberate practice project. This type of project combines a few elements:</p><ol><li> <strong>It should be focused and specific—not just routine work</strong> , but something “extra” that will force your skills to a higher level.</li><li> <strong>You should have an opportunity to study from examples to see how the best do it</strong> . Figuring out everything on your own is slow, so a good project begins with a clear picture of how the skill you&#39;re trying to improve works.</li><li> <strong>You should be able to get clear feedback that can drive your progress.</strong></li></ol><p> Designing a good project is not trivial. You need to find something that is a good fit for the career capital you want to develop. Then, you need to focus your project so that improvement is possible—while keeping it relevant to your working life. Finally, you need to do the work. Each step has its challenges.</p><p> However, as we&#39;ve seen with past cohorts from Top Performer, students can succeed with these kinds of projects, and their newly developed skills help them make strides in their work.

Next, I applied the economic model of supply and demand to understand <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/">why some people are able to negotiate great career perks</a> —money, autonomy, flexibility—while others are not.</p><p> Career capital, particularly rare and valuable skills, is the starting point for finding work you love. But how do you get them?</p><p> A tempting answer is simply to work hard. While it&#39;s true that success requires hard work and most successful people tend to be hard workers, working hard does not guarantee success.</p><p> While it&#39;s nearly impossible to build rare and valuable skills without hard work, tons of people work hard but still don&#39;t have great career capital. As a result, despite their great work ethic, they don&#39;t get the same perks that true top performers do. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15391" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Cal and My First Lesson from 8+ Years of Top Performer</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1618905267&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> You avoid this trap by building skills that result in useful career capital, so the nuts and bolts of <em>how</em> to build these skills were on Cal Newport&#39;s and my mind as we began working on the first iterations of our course, <a href="http://www.top-performer-course.com">Top Performer</a> .</p><p> We already had an idea about how people build skills—Anders Ericsson, the psychologist who pioneered the concept of deliberate practice, spent decades studying the mental efforts needed to master difficult skills. Focused practice sessions, particularly under the supervision of a coach, can make all the difference in whether your skills will grow or stagnate.</p><p> However, when we ran our first sessions for the course, we noticed something different: <em><strong>Most people had no idea which skills they needed to build!</strong></em></p><p> Worse, many people seemed to gravitate towards skills tangential to what really would make a difference. People seemed keen to improve skills that were fun to work on—an effortful project (but not too hard) so they could feel they were doing something to improve, but they weren&#39;t working on what mattered most.</p><p> There&#39;s nothing wrong with learning things for fun. But this approach can be counterproductive if your aim is to build career capital. You can spend months improving a skill that isn&#39;t directly related to what employers, clients or customers really want.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> There are No Short-Cuts, But Plenty of Dead-Ends</h2><p> Realizing that many people were heading down dead-ends with their deliberate practice efforts, Cal and I adjusted our next iteration of the course: Before getting into intensive skill-building work, we had the students research how their career path <em>actually</em> worked. Once they understood this, they better understood which projects would move them in the right direction—and which ones were a waste of time.</p><p> Doing this kind of research is tricky. Most of what you need to know is too specific to be written down in a book or article, so a trip to the library or a web search often comes up short. Instead, you need to talk to people. Yet talking to people who&#39;ve achieved success can be equally frustrating! Even people who have amassed a surprisingly specific set of skills often shrink back to generic platitudes about the value of hard work when asked how they did it.</p><p> However, doing this research properly is essential. Knowing the path before you start walking it helps you avoid common traps people fall into when building their career:</p><ol><li> Getting a master&#39;s degree that nobody cares about.</li><li> Working on technical skills when you need people skills.</li><li> Not finding the right way to present your skills on your resume.</li><li> Not recognizing which jobs are career-building opportunities and which are dead-ends.</li></ol><p> After working with many students over the years, Cal and I found that the best people to talk to for this advice are 2 to 3 steps ahead of you in the career direction you&#39;re considering. These people have recently moved up, so their information is up-to-date and fresh in their mind.</p><p> Once you find and contact these people, you need to get them to tell you how they got where they are—which is surprisingly diffcult. Early on, Cal and I found that our students were simply asking those people for advice. While this seems like the obvious move, it almost never works. Instead of asking directly, you need to act like a journalist covering the story of this person&#39;s career transition—figure out the where, when, what and why of how they made the career leap you&#39;re currently contemplating.</p><p> These two actions, <strong>finding people 2 or 3 steps ahead of you</strong> in your career and <strong>interviewing them to figure out exactly what they did</strong> (not just the advice they want to share), help you narrow down which elements of your career capital you need to invest in and which you can ignore going forward.</p><p> In the next and final lesson, I&#39;ll share my thoughts on moving beyond identifying valuable skills to actually getting good at them. After that, Cal and I will be opening <a href="https://www.top-performer-course.com">Top Performer</a> for a new session. If the ideas I&#39;ve been sharing have resonated with you, I think you&#39;ll enjoy the full course where we put them into practice.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/14/before-burn-out/">Before You Burn Yourself Out Working, Do This</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/14/before-burn-out/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Simple Economic Theory That Explains Whether You&#39;ll Have a Great Career</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 15:51:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15373 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Applying Econ 101 to understand why some people have great jobs ... and others don&#39;t.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/">The Simple Economic Theory That Explains Whether You&#39;ll Have a Great Career</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> In the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/">last lesson</a> , I explained why focusing on irrelevant details obscures the true driver of professional success: career capital.</p><p> But the connection between career capital and a great career isn&#39;t always obvious. Why does the owner of a car dealership tend to make more than a nurse or a teacher? Why would most people struggle to make a living as an artist, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst">guy who put a taxidermied shark in a tank</a> is worth nearly half a billion dollars?</p><p> The basic answer of whether you&#39;ll have a great career can be understood in terms of the simple economic concept of supply and demand.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Supply-and-Demand Thinking Applied to Your Working Life</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1616061396&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> Let&#39;s start with demand.</p><p> Economists draw a downward-sloping curve to represent how much of something people want for a given price. The vertical axis is how much something costs, and the horizontal axis is how many people are willing to pay for the thing at each price. All else being equal, fewer people are willing (or able) to pay for something when the price is higher. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15375" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-1-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> This curve can be a useful way to think about the value you offer to other people. In the job market, your career capital is valuable if people are willing to pay more for it. A higher-value set of career capital can be represented by the demand curve shifting to the right—more people want someone with your career capital for any particular price. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15376" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> But demand isn&#39;t the whole story. Water is essential for life, diamonds are not. But water is cheap because the supply of water is plentiful, and diamonds are expensive because the supply of diamonds is scarce.</p><p> Similarly, the supply curve for your career can be envisioned as the number of people who are willing to supply that career capital (the horizontal axis) for a particular wage (the vertical axis). As the price goes up, more people are willing to supply those skills, connections, reputation and other assets that people want. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15377" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> The supply curve can also be a measure of the scarcity of your particular career capital. Teachers and nurses earn less than many car dealership owners because there are more people who have the career assets to teach children or work as nurses than own big lots that can sell lots of cars. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15378" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> In a normally functioning market, the intersection between the demand and supply curves reflects the price and quantity sold of a given product. If demand is high and the supply is low, the price goes up.</p><p> In a career context, the return on your career capital depends on how many people value it, and how many others can supply it. This means to have a good career position, you need assets that are both rare and valuable. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15379" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TP-Lesson-2-5.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> This thinking applies beyond just how much money you make. The person with rare and valuable career assets can, of course, parlay that into a higher income. But those same assets also serve as a negotiating point for anything else you might want: vacation time, interesting projects, professional autonomy, and more. A career you love and a career that pays well may not always be the same thing, but they&#39;re both made possible with rare and valuable career capital.</p><p> As a mental model, I find supply-and-demand thinking incredibly useful, but it ignores a lot of important factors. Price caps, monopsonistic employers, professional guilds restricting membership, and more all complicate this basic model. However, it&#39;s still a good baseline for thinking about the kind of career you can have.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Building Rare and Valuable Skills</h2><p> As discussed in the previous lesson, skills are often the best starting point for building career capital. Reputation and connections tend to follow, not precede, excellent work, so the best place to start is building the skills that support doing excellent work.</p><p> This view reframes the question from how to build a valuable career to: <strong>How do you acquire rare and valuable skills?</strong></p><p> This was the opening question Cal and I posed when we first started building our course, <a href="https://www.top-performer-course.com">Top Performer</a> . In the coming two lessons, I&#39;ll share two major findings from working on this issue with thousands of students over nearly a decade. We&#39;re setting up for a new session, starting next week. If you&#39;re interested in building the career capital that actually drives a great career, I hope you&#39;ll join us.</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/">The Simple Economic Theory That Explains Whether You&#39;ll Have a Great Career</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/12/economic-theory-great-career/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Who Cares What Warren Buffett Eats for Lunch?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Sun, 10 Sep 2023 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15367 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Why do we obsess over irrelevant personality quirks, instead of what really drives a person&#39;s success?</p><p> The post <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/">Who Cares What Warren Buffett Eats for Lunch?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> A pet peeve of mine is self-help advice that obsesses over irrelevant personality quirks rather than the true drivers of a person&#39;s success.</p><ul><li> Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/18/billionaire-ray-dalio-how-transcendental-meditation-helps-me-succeed.html">meditates forty minutes per day</a> .</li><li> Tim Ferriss wrote his bestselling books <a href="https://www.behance.net/blog/tim-ferriss-on-the-creative-process-and-getting-your-work-noticed">between 10 pm and 5 am</a> .</li><li> Warren Buffett famously drinks <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-diet-mcdonalds-coke-junk-food-soda-ice-cream-2023-4">five cans of Coca-Cola every day</a> .</li><li> And so on …</li></ul><p> There isn&#39;t any secret diet, exercise, meditation or journaling exercise that will make you successful.

These are the assets they have that directly produce value for their employers, clients or customers:</p><ol><li> <strong>Skills.</strong> If you can do work few other people can, or you can do it better than most people, you have a powerful bargaining chip when looking for work. People with rare and valuable skills can set off bidding wars in negotiations, whereas people with mediocre levels of common skills usually cannot.</li><li> <strong>Connections.</strong> Relationships can also be an asset. A journalist with a long career can often get a book deal, not only because she&#39;s spent years honing her writing skills, but also because she knows tons of people throughout the publishing industry who can talk about her book.</li><li> <strong>Reputation.</strong> How do you choose which products to buy? Chances are you don&#39;t buy each possible option and test them at home before returning all but your favorite. Instead of relying on reviews, you pick brands that are high-quality for their price range and ask people you know. The same is true when people hire you.</li></ol><p> Career capital explains success in a way that incidental habits cannot. While it&#39;s easy to find examples of people who attribute their success to a particular behavioral quirk, it&#39;s also easy to find plenty of cases where people with the same behavior <em>don&#39;t</em> achieve such success.</p><p> In contrast, if someone has a successful career, they&#39;re virtually guaranteed to have a lot of career capital.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> How to Build Career Capital</h2><p> Career capital comes in different flavors, and we&#39;ve already discussed three: skills, connections and reputation.</p><p> Among these assets, skill tends to come first.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15367' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/10/warren-buffett-lunch/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15367' title="Credentials, another kind of asset, also matter. But I’m lumping them together with the “skill” category since getting a credential usually involves relevant training."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Connections are nice if you&#39;re born into a wealthy family, or went to an elite private school and have a great network. But if you don&#39;t, knocking on the doors of random successful people, hoping they&#39;ll be your friend and help you out, is not a strategy most people can pull off.</p><p> More commonly, connections follow from doing good work. When you make a name for yourself as being excellent at what you do, people will want to get to know you.</p><p> Similarly, reputation often matters more than raw ability. But, as with connections, reputation is a natural by-product of doing excellent work. Reputation follows skill, not the other way around.</p><p> Skills also have the benefit of being trainable.
