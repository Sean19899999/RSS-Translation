</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>在上周的作文中，我写了关于<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/">学习过于耐心</a>的问题。</p><p>特别是，我挑选了一些基于简单、最低限度习惯的学习项目——比如，每天花五分钟在 Duolingo 上学习一门语言，或者每周写一页小说。</p><p>回顾一下：</p><ul><li>虽然流行，但这种方法限制了您可以进行的活动类型，通常会消除最有效的练习。</li><li>漫长的时间框架让人很难判断你是否在取得进步，也很难相应地调整你的方法。</li><li>最后，虽然养成简单的习惯可以成为进入困难行为的良好垫脚石，但对于许多人来说，每天五分钟的例行程序成为了一个目的地，而不是一个热身活动。</li></ul><p>虽然最小习惯方法有问题，但我应该注意到密集型项目也有问题！密集型项目难以安排，执行起来具有挑战性，并且可能缺乏足够的空间来长期保留。</p><p>最好的方法不是坚定地坚持一种特定的格式来实现目标，而是了解每种格式的优点和缺点。所以，今天我想探讨一下，什么样的学习最小习惯实际上是有用的。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">什么是最小习惯？</h2><p>最低限度的习惯学习方法，只要你能长期坚持，就有两个关键优势：间隔和方便。</p><p> spacing 指的是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">间距效应</a>，一种被充分研究的现象。当我们接触信息的时间间隔较长时，我们会更好地保留信息，而不是在较短的时间内发生相同数量的接触。因此，与在一小时内看到十次相比，在十天内看到一个词汇项目十次会导致更持久的记忆。通过在很长的时间范围内进行学习，极简习惯可以潜在地利用间隔效应，从而比拥挤的日程表产生更持久的记忆。</p><p>最小习惯的第二个优点是它们很方便。正如我在上一篇文章中提到的，阻止人们养成最低限度的习惯感觉很卑鄙，因为另一种选择通常是什么都不做。生活很忙，学习很辛苦，有时你只有十分钟的空闲时间。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15217' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15217' title="当人们有&lt;em>;几个&lt;/em>;学习不同事物的最低习惯时，这个论点在某种程度上被反驳了，这表明他们可以一次只做一件事，但很难决定要专注于哪一个。"><sup>1个</sup></a></span></p><p>鉴于这两个优势，我认为有必要研究一下哪种类型的学习目标可能适合长期传播的简单、最少的习惯。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">什么时候应该养成最低限度的习惯？</h2><p>根据我的最小习惯心智模型，我希望它们在练习活动的认知负荷较低并且可以适应较小的时间空间时起作用。</p><p><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">认知负荷理论</a>背后的基本思想是，信息必须通过意识体验的狭窄瓶颈才能让学习发生。复杂的科目和技能，那些包含许多信息的东西必须放在一起才能理解它们，这会造成很高的认知负担。这就是学习数学和物理困难的原因之一。</p><p>然而，认知负荷对于一个主题来说并不是恒定的！在您学习的过程中，您的大脑会使用分块或提取线索等机制来最大程度地减少工作记忆的负担。例如，当你刚开始学习阅读时，它的认知负荷非常高，因为你必须努力识别每个字母。但最终，随着你自动识别单词和句子，阅读的认知负荷会变低。</p><p>新的学习对工作记忆的要求各不相同。一些技能和概念本质上具有更高的认知负荷，因为它们有许多新的、相互作用的部分。相比之下，其他思想本质上是相互隔离的，可以一次学习一个。</p><p>考虑学习计算化学中的量子力学轨道与记忆元素周期表中的质量。前者有很多信息，需要同时使用这些信息来执行计算。相反，记忆任务涉及（大部分）不相关的事实。</p><p>鉴于此，抽认卡可能会帮助您记住周期性质量，但它们对于学习求解微分方程以找到电子轨道的效果并不好。计算任务中的各种问题需要你将大量信息“加载”到短期记忆中，因此，对于除了最有经验的化学家之外的所有人来说，有效的练习活动看起来更像是一个你必须关注的问题集一段时间。</p><p><strong>与转移到新的技能前沿相比，最低限度的习惯可能更适合保持知识和流利程度。</strong>随着时间的推移持续、重复的练习对于提高流利度是理想的，但它对于在存在纠正性反馈的情况下进行有意识的调整效果较差。</p><p>因此，低调的日常写作习惯可能会让写作变得<em>更容易</em>，但它可能无法帮助你达到更高的熟练程度。后者可能需要刻意的练习限制，迫使您使用不会自动出现的样式或结构，并且需要一定的专注和努力（可能还有一些外部反馈）。作为最低限度的习惯，这是很难或不可能维持的。</p><p>对最小习惯的另一个限制是，练习活动需要在每天的一小段时间里适应——并且是有效的。因此，例如高山滑雪，可能无法成为大多数人的最低限度的习惯，因为它需要在雪山上长途跋涉才能开始练习。许多技能很难最低限度地练习，因为没有相关的类型实践将适合该时间范围。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度习惯可能起作用的一些例子</h2><p>我过去使用过最少的习惯——无论是有效的还是无效的。上面阐述的理论阐明了我认为它们起作用的地方（以及它们失败的地方）。特别是，我认为极简习惯可能适用于：</p><ul><li><strong>广泛的学科知识。</strong>每天阅读博客、教育 YouTube 视频或浏览相关的 subreddit 不会产生专业知识。尽管如此，它仍然可以让您很好地<em>了解</em>主要思想，即使您需要认真练习才能熟练使用它们。</li><li><strong>抽认卡和记忆孤立的事实。</strong>可以变成原子的、独立的、可快速测试的知识片段的东西也是很好的候选者。我已经成功地利用碎片化的时间学习了很多词汇，这对保持知识也有好处。</li><li><strong>流利并保持既定技能。</strong>保持最小的努力可以帮助提高材料的流畅性，这是最终掌握的重要部分。</li></ul><p>相比之下，我认为极简习惯不太适合需要刻意练习的情况；学习新的、复杂的技能；或者在最小习惯要求的时间/努力限制内无法进行有效练习时。</p><p>重要的是要注意耐心/不耐心的区别往往与实际花费的学习时间的更大考虑相形见绌。根据<a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">一些合理的估计</a>，掌握一门语言可能需要 500-2000 小时的课堂时间。如果您要按照每天五分钟的方法使用“硬”语言（例如普通话），那将意味着您将近 70 年才能达到这个门槛！如果您实际上没有进行足够的练习，那么即使是最有效的学习策略也无法帮助您实现目标。</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/20/minimal-habits-learning/">什么时候起码的习惯对学习有用？</a>首先出现在<a rel="nofollow"

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>掌握通常与耐心有关。毕竟，精通一件事需要很长时间，只有长期从事这项工作的人才能期望达到其技艺的顶峰。</p><p>考虑到这种共同的联想，我发现从泰格·伍德的教练<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Pro-Lessons-Father-Claude-Harmon/dp/0307338045">布奇·哈蒙 (Butch Harmon)</a>那里听到相反的观点很有趣，他是泰格·伍德高尔夫职业生涯的最佳时期：</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>那些坚持耐心并让比赛自然而然到来的高尔夫球手很少能发挥出自己的潜力。他们打得很好，也许赢过一两次，但他们从来没有达到他们的天赋所决定的高度。想要立即学习、变得更好并赢得胜利的玩家——这一刻，没有等待——是那些超越他们的自然能力并成为游戏中伟大的超级成功者的玩家。</p></blockquote><p>哈蒙后来继续解释为什么老虎是他见过的最没有耐心的人之一：</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>当老虎想用他的高尔夫挥杆动作做点什么时，他希望现在就完成。没有分阶段实施，也没有长期规划。一旦他决定做出改变，他就会立即全力以赴。然后他衣衫褴褛地工作，直到他把它完善起来，一路上几乎没有耐心。</p></blockquote><p>在 Harmon 看来，耐心往往是一厢情愿的想法：对未来熟练程度的希望阻止你今天真正地工作在你想要改进的地方。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">每天五分钟的问题和学习困难的事情</h2><p>哈蒙的话让我想到了自我提升圈子里经常看到的一个现象。它认为对学习来说最重要的是在很长一段时间内每天做一点点事情。</p><p>这种方法的例子有语言学习者计划通过每天玩 5 分钟 Duolingo 来流利地使用一门语言，有志成为小说家的人承诺每周写一页，或者有抱负的摄影师每天拍一张照片。</p><p>劝阻这种方法感觉很卑鄙。毕竟，大多数人都没有为自己的愿望做任何事情，所以做点什么，哪怕是一点点，也比什么都不做要好。不是吗？</p><p>然而，我不禁觉得这种方法类似于哈蒙的“耐心”高尔夫球手的一厢情愿——他们利用最终掌握的缓慢来逃避要求苛刻的学习工作。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">最低限度习惯的逻辑</h2><p>在这一点上，重新审视为什么这种方法在自我提升圈子中如此受欢迎可能会有所帮助。 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y6PQC6WUTD4Y&amp;keywords=atomic+habits&amp;qid=1656002761&amp;sprefix=atomic+hab%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1">原子习惯</a>是我朋友詹姆斯·克利尔 (James Clear) 写的一本出色的畅销书，是“从小处着手”自我提升方法最明显的支持者之一。</p><p>养成习惯的逻辑令人信服：</p><ol><li>开始很难。</li><li>小习惯更容易养成。</li><li>一旦开始，就更容易提升并做更多事情。</li></ol><p>因此，按照逻辑，每天在 Duolingo 上花 10 分钟的人正在为练习与人交谈的更大习惯积累动力。通过降低进入门槛，他们开始了自我完善的过程，而抱有很高的期望可能会让人难以起步。</p><p>换句话说，微习惯的逻辑是不可否认的。我认为这是开始任何事情的重要行为技巧，尤其是当您尝试做的事情感觉不愉快时。当我不想这样做时，我已经使用这种方法重新开始锻炼。我永远不会批评某人从较小的、令人愉快的习惯开始，然后进入他们觉得令人沮丧或不愉快但想要结果的事情。</p><p>我关心的是#3。从理论上讲，一旦开始就很容易提高并做更多事情。但在实践中，最小的习惯往往成为目的地，而不是为更大的事情做热身。而且我怀疑这种“耐心”的练习方法能否可靠地带来实质性的改进。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> “耐心”的掌握方法有多有效？</h2><p>我不知道有任何研究专门将“每天五分钟”的习惯与人们想要掌握的技能的更典型课程相比较。纵向研究的成本和困难意味着实证研究在延长的时间范围内通常有些不足。</p><p>心理学中的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">间隔效应</a>似乎支持缓慢、耐心的方法。当复习信息之间的间隔比将相同的复习集中在一起时（如为考试临时抱佛脚）时，记忆往往更持久。然而，语言学习的真实世界研究<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/02/07/learning-fast-or-slow/">往往会发现相反的情况</a>，发现更密集的课程比更延伸的方法更有优势。</p><p>我的猜测是哪种方法更有效，是每天五分钟还是密集爆发，取决于所学技能的确切性质、所使用的练习活动以及学习者开始时所掌握的知识。我怀疑复杂的技能有利于更深入的方法，而广泛的、基于知识的科目往往有利于更耐心的方法。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15198' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/13/too-patient/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15198' title="究竟什么样的技能（或子技能）会从不同的学习计划中受益，这超出了本文的范围。例如，通过抽认卡学习词汇似乎很适合较长的时间安排，但对话所需的程序流畅性可能会受益于更密集的时间安排。同样，通过观看录制的讲座来学习历史可能是从容不迫的，但培养历史学家的分析技能需要更有针对性的方法。我在这里的观点是，我关于某些类别的“长期习惯”对其目的无效的论点不应被误解为相反的观点，即密集的时间表总是更适合获得所有类型的技能。"><sup>1个</sup></a></span></p><p>然而，这种分析可能无关紧要，因为一般来说，当人们选择每天五分钟的习惯时，他们为学习所做的事情与他们在典型的课堂环境中或作为学习的一部分所做的事情截然不同。一个专注的学习项目。</p><p>在这里，“耐心”的方法有几个严重的缺点：</p><ul><li><strong>有限的时间限制了您可以进行的练习类型。</strong>每天五分钟，你可以在 Duolingo 上完成一个练习，但有意义的对话练习需要更多时间。观看某人绘画的视频可以在五分钟内完成，但自己复制那幅画需要更多时间。</li><li><strong>关注“可持续性”可以避免必要的努力</strong>。当您选择旨在持续数月或数年的活动时，会倾向于选择过于费力或耗时的活动。这消除了实现精通所需的大量密集、刻意的练习。</li><li><strong>较长的时间框架让您更难判断您是否正在取得进展</strong>。当您在几个月内学到很多东西时，进步是显而易见的。如果你没有取得进步，你就会改变你的方法。当预期在未来数年内会出现改进时，您如何知道您是否真的在基础技能上变得更好了？</li></ul><p>出于这些原因，我对我从读者那里听到的许多通过简单、长期的习惯来达到精通的计划表示怀疑。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">精通是缓慢的——而且不耐烦</h2><p>在他对<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">刻意练习的</a>研究中，安德斯·埃里克森阐明了与我最接近的精通观点。他认为精通是一个缓慢的过程，也是一个不耐烦的过程：</p><ul><li><strong>掌握起来很慢，因为它需要很长时间</strong>。不，<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">我的书</a>也不例外。我确实认为可以更有效地学习，并且有效设计的项目可以帮助人们完成比他们想象的更多的事情。但是真正的精通（不仅仅是相对快速的中级能力）需要很长时间，而且我所做的一切都不是这个规则的例外。</li><li><strong>精通是不耐烦的，因为所需的工作是深思熟虑、努力和奋斗的</strong>。刻意练习是爱立信用来描述国际象棋、音乐和体育领域的精英表演者所付出的学习努力的术语。它清楚地描述了哈蒙最著名的学生老虎伍兹。</li></ul><p>我相信这是真的，即使你不渴望成为世界级的伟人。即使变得“足够好”也需要一定程度的承诺，仅靠最低限度的习惯是难以达到的。</p><p><a

class="wp-block-heading">直接检索是学习的最终目标</h2><p>从经验上看，助记符有点混杂。抽认卡似乎有优势，至少在对未受过助记技巧训练的学生进行长期回忆的仔细控制研究中是如此。</p><p>认知理论也支持这一观点。技能习得的一个主要特点是获得结果所使用的方法不是一成不变的。 <a

class="wp-block-heading">我们是否对学习投资不足？</h2><p>总而言之，许多关于学习的决定具有以下特征：</p><ul><li>自己动手最初并不能通过成本效益测试。</li><li>练习的越多，成本就越低。</li><li>因此，学习某事是否“值得”取决于对使用该技能需要多少时间的远见计算。</li></ul><p>不幸的是，我们内在的激励系统的<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/12/14/procrastinate-expert/">关注点非常短视</a>。直接成本或回报对我们决策的影响远大于长期成本或回报。实验表明，人们通常会以与任何理性代理人（即使是极度冲动的代理人）<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-02">不一致的方式</a>为延迟奖励支付高额折扣率。</p><p>这表明我们可能在学习上投资不足。我们不愿意练习未能通过初始成本效益分析的技能——即使我们的练习投资在我们的一生中会获利。</p><p>这种洞察力在学习其他语言时帮助了 Vat 和我。当您不经常使用一门语言时，练习该语言的成本相对较高。在短期内，强迫自己使用一种新语言进行交互也是代价高昂的。但是，如果您练习得足够多，说您所访问国家/地区的语言会比完全停留在英语圈内更容易。成年人足智多谋，经常想方设法避免使用不熟悉的语言；结果是，很少有人能接触到幼儿在学习时情不自禁接触到的水平。</p><h2

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">马太效应</a>最早是由社会学家罗伯特·默顿和哈里特·祖克曼在他们对精英科学家的研究中提出的。杰出的科学家通常比不知名的研究人员在类似的工作中获得更多的荣誉，这意味着，随着时间的推移，知名度往往会增加，而不太知名的学者则默默无闻。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15172'

In <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12272">a study looking at identical twins</a> who varied in early reading ability, the slightly more proficient twin later showed gains in intelligence compared with their genetically-identical sibling. Skills beget skills; knowledge begets knowledge.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Specialization and Focusing on Strengths</h2><p> At this point, it&#39;s helpful to clarify. I&#39;m not suggesting that since learned skills get easier with practice, we should do everything for ourselves and never delegate.</p><p> This is false, even by the basic logic I&#39;ve spelled out above. Some tasks simply aren&#39;t encountered frequently enough to cross the cost/benefit threshold. I may never have an opportunity to speak Mongolian, so if I ever meet a monolingual Mongolian speaker, I&#39;d be happy to lean on Google Translate.</p><p> Additionally, we can&#39;t consider skills in isolation. Spending time learning one thing is an implicit decision not to learn something else. I could learn French, but that time is taken away from learning Mandarin. I could learn Javascript, but that time can&#39;t also be spent learning Python.</p><p> Ultimately, specialization, not self-sufficiency, is the road to abundance in the world we live in today. We delegate the vast majority of skills in our lives, not because learning them all is impossible, but because getting really good at one thing makes sense when it&#39;s relatively easy to delegate everything else.</p><p> Despite spending years learning programming, I do virtually none of it for my own business. Given that my writing is central to my business, and I don&#39;t have enough time to do all the writing I&#39;d like, hiring other people to do the programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">makes more sense</a> . Those people, in turn, tend to be much further along the expertise curve than I am because they&#39;ve made a similar decision to specialize.</p><p> That being said, there are many instances where skills can&#39;t easily be delegated. I might be able to hire out behind-the-scenes programming for my website, but it doesn&#39;t save effort or cost to hire someone to read the research used to write the articles. If I don&#39;t understand the research, I can&#39;t weave it into the text I&#39;m producing.</p><p> In other cases, delegation is an imperfect or inconvenient substitute for being able to do something yourself. Relying on a translator is not equivalent to being able to speak the language yourself when you move to another country. Being able to read a text isn&#39;t made redundant if someone narrates it to you aloud. Thus being able to speak the language of the country you live in and being able to read are skills that are almost certainly worth mastering.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Thinking about Learning in the Long-Term</h2><p> I find it useful to keep in mind a few things when I face resistance to learning something new:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. How much can I expect this skill to get easier with more practice?</h3><p> One way to estimate this is to look at people with varying degrees of experience. How much effort did it take them to do what you struggle with? The learning curve is quite steep for some skills—you get good relatively quickly. For others, the curve is flat for a long time—you may need to practice for years before you feel it&#39;s worth the effort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. How much would I use the skill if I was better at it?</h3><p> Supposing you could reach the relatively flat part of the practice curve, how much would you use it?</p><p> If you live in a country that speaks a language you don&#39;t know, learning that language would definitely pass the cost-benefit test. Learning a major world language you might use in work or educational contexts probably also does. A niche language that isn&#39;t spoken much … maybe not? In this case, it may only be worth learning if you have a strong intrinsic motivation to learn it.</p><p> If a skill is central to your career, it may easily be worth the cost, even if it is initially difficult for you to learn. In contrast, a career skill that doesn&#39;t fit well with your existing skills may go unused even if you&#39;re nearly an expert—it&#39;s simply cheaper to outsource.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. How much would I enjoy the skill, conditional on being better at it?</h3><p> Economic rewards aren&#39;t the only motivation. If you&#39;re good at something, you tend to enjoy it more and draw personal satisfaction. But that&#39;s more true of some skills than others. You might be particularly proud of being able to paint a realistic landscape but not feel too special about being able to file your taxes quickly.</p><p> Deciding when it makes sense to learn isn&#39;t trivial, but given that our intuitions often give us a misleadingly short-term picture of what&#39;s possible, it can be helpful to think more deeply about it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/">When is Learning Worth the Effort?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/30/learning-cost-benefit/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15151 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Need to learn something difficult?

Of those that do, they often make mistakes that render the plan highly unrealistic—a recipe for future guilt, not future learning.</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to outline how to make a studying plan—and how you can stick to it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Make a Studying Plan?</h2><p> Learning is effortful. Although that effort can be enjoyable, our impulses about what to do in the moment often don&#39;t coincide with what would maximize learning. Indeed, the research shows that students frequently <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">choose activities</a> that feel fun but don&#39;t deliver results.</p><p> A good analogy is exercise. While playing a sport or going for a jog can be fun, our brains are designed to avoid unnecessary physical exertion. That&#39;s why you rarely see anyone over the age of ten running down the street unless they&#39;re late for an appointment.</p><p> If you want to develop fitness without injuring yourself, it helps to have a workout plan you can and will stick to, rather than just going to the gym whenever you feel like and working on whatever equipment you stumble into.</p><p> The logic is the same for studying. Having a plan maximizes the chance of investing effort where it counts to create learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step One: Review Your Materials </h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already chosen some class, book, tutorials or other curriculum to guide you. (If you haven&#39;t, the first step is to do your research and find a good resource for the skill you&#39;re trying to learn!)</p><p> The starting point is to review your curriculum and figure out:</p><ul><li> What are the lessons you&#39;ll need to watch/read/review?</li><li> What are the practice activities you need to engage in?</li><li> What are the required deliverables (essays/homework) you need to complete?</li><li> How will you need to use the skills and knowledge you&#39;ve gained? Consider things like the format of the final exam as well as where you plan to apply the skills and knowledge you&#39;re learning.</li></ul><p> A pure practice project may be an exception. In this kind of project, you&#39;re not working off materials but trying to practice or implement knowledge you&#39;ve gained elsewhere. For a practice project, you&#39;re creating your own curriculum, so you can choose your own pace. These tend to be more successful when you&#39;ve gone beyond the beginner period and can more successfully guide your own practice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Two: Calculate Your Minimum Time Investment</h2><p> The minimum time investment includes all the work you must put in to complete the class as specified.这包括：</p><ul><li> How long will it take to do the required readings?</li><li> How long will it take to watch any videos/lectures/lessons?</li><li> How long will it take to finish the required deliverables (homework, essays, projects)?</li></ul><p> Videos and recorded lectures are easy to estimate: you can add up the run time of all the videos. Will you be able to <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">watch at an accelerated pace</a> ? If so, you can divide the total by the estimated playback rate (eg, 1.5 or 2 times speed). Otherwise, this time is a fixed amount based on how long the lessons are.</p><p> For required readings, you need an estimate of your reading rate. You can get a first approximation by timing yourself reading a few pages and extrapolating that to the whole book. Read slowly and deliberately; the speed for long reading sessions is inevitably slower than a few-minute sprint.</p><p> Homework is hard to estimate in advance, but you may be able to get an estimate from the course provider, teacher or past students.</p><p> The general idea here is to calculate the minimum time investment to work through the materials you&#39;ve been provided—without any additional studying.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Three: Estimate Additional Studying Time Needs</h2><p> For some classes, simply doing all the work assigned will allow you to pass the test and apply it in real life. But for most classes, you&#39;ll have to go beyond this.</p><p> Some additional places you might expect to invest time are:</p><ul><li> Extra practice questions/homework.</li><li> Application to real-life problems and contexts.</li><li> Creating/reviewing flashcards.</li><li> Self-explanations, such as the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">Feynman Technique</a> .</li><li> Extra research not mentioned in the syllabus.</li></ul><p> A good way to estimate this is by looking at your personal historical data: how much time have you typically needed to invest, beyond the minimum curriculum, to achieve the results you want from the class? There&#39;s no “correct” answer here. Some classes are time-intensive, and the required material is challenging to get through. Other classes are sparse and leave it to students to master the material on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Four: Schedule Studying in Your Calendar</h2><p> Once you have an itemized list of your expected time investment, you need to figure out when you&#39;re actually going to do everything.</p><p> Put any due dates, exams, live lectures or lessons directly in your calendar. For reading, working on homework, practice efforts and other forms of studying, you should still allocate time for them, but there are two different ways to do it:</p><ul><li> <strong>The most rigorous option is to schedule everything as an appointment.</strong> I recommend this approach if studying has to fit inside an already crowded schedule. So if you&#39;re a busy parent and professional studying for a licensing exam, you&#39;d better put studying time directly in your calendar, or it will get pushed to the side in the moment.</li><li> <strong>The more flexible option is to create a weekly or daily routine.</strong> The exact activities in each block would vary depending on your goals, but the time commitments themselves would be relatively routine. For instance, you might decide to study every morning before work, or in the evenings, or on weekends.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Five: Sanity Check</h2><p> At this point in the process, we can do a basic sanity check: how does your calculated time investment from Step Two and Step Three compare with the time you&#39;ve scheduled?   If your available time for the project is less than the estimated minimum, you&#39;ve already got a non-starter. You need to clear more time in your schedule, rethink the aims of the learning project, or expand the timeline you are allowing to complete it.</p><p> If your available time is slightly over what you&#39;ve budgeted, you have little room for error. Getting sick, an unexpectedly challenging topic or a surprise interruption could derail the whole project.</p><p> If you have substantially more time available than you&#39;ve budgeted, that&#39;s not necessarily a sign to relax. With too much slack, you might not feel the pressure to study when you need to and end up wasting time procrastinating. In those cases, I recommend setting soft deadlines that push the work ahead of the more relaxed schedule. This approach can keep the pressure comfortable but challenging, so you have more room for error later.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Six: Getting Feedback</h2><p> Making a plan is the easy part. The hard part is sticking to it. Fortunately, if you keep an eye on the feedback you&#39;re getting while you&#39;re studying and adjust accordingly, the plan you make can be an invaluable guide rather than something that gets tossed aside at the first brush with difficulty.</p><p> Consider these sources of feedback:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Feedback on sticking to your schedule.</h3><p> The first source of feedback is your ability to implement the plan. A helpful strategy is simply to write your intention on an agenda or planner each day and then record what you actually did. For example, you might have intended to study for three hours on Wednesday, but you were interrupted and only got in two hours.</p><p> Whenever there are deviations from your plan, it&#39;s helpful to note the source of the obstacle. Even though you can&#39;t control everything that deflects you from your plan, few obstacles are insurmountable if you can recognize them. Consider:</p><ul><li> <strong>Deviations due to interruptions from others.</strong> Communicate boundaries for your studying time so others appreciate its importance. If you can&#39;t avoid interruptions, find fall-back studying slots in your schedule to make up for occasional, unavoidable interruptions.</li><li> <strong>Deviations from lack of preparation.</strong> Your computer died. You couldn&#39;t log into your account to access the lesson. You had to buy colored pencils. Find a way to do these things before your scheduled session or eliminate them as unnecessary.</li><li> <strong>Deviations because of procrastination/motivation.</strong> Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a> , lower your expectations for proficiency in the session to avoid perfectionism, or alternate between reading/practice to avoid mind wandering or boredom.</li></ul><p> Learning is effortful and genuine obstacles can arise, making it hard to stick to one&#39;s plan. However, if you can identify what is causing the interruptions, you can find remedies in many cases.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Feedback on your learning progress.</h3><p> The second source of feedback concerns your progress in learning. Sometimes skills and subjects gel instantly, and you don&#39;t need to review them. In other cases, the new material can seem bewildering and exceed your estimates of how long it will take to master.</p><p> Once again, the key is to observe the feedback and break it down:</p><ul><li> <strong>Are you struggling because the basics aren&#39;t firmly entrenched?</strong> Drills, flashcards and repeated practice on simple problems can help fix this.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you don&#39;t understand a difficult idea?</strong> Self-explanations, talking to teachers/peers/tutors and finding alternative explanatory sources can be helpful.</li><li> <strong>Are you struggling because you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing wrong or how to improve it?</strong> Seeking coaching, corrective feedback or guidance may be helpful.</li></ul><p> The more granular you can be in identifying your problems, the easier they are to resolve. Zooming in on particular concepts, movements, facts or procedures is the key to getting past difficulties.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Step Seven: Making Modifications</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve gotten some feedback, you may need to modify your plan. That might involve increasing the hours you invest if you&#39;re falling behind, or you might change your routine so that you can actually invest the hours you said you would.</p><p> In the end, you may not stick to your plan with total rigidity. The primary benefit of planning isn&#39;t to eliminate all improvisation and flexibility. Rather it&#39;s to marshal the resources of time and energy needed to learn and identify obstacles ahead of time so you can avoid most of them. What&#39;s ultimately useful is less the plan itself, but the thinking that goes into creating it.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/">Seven Steps for Making a Solid Studying Plan</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/23/studying-plan/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 16 May 2023 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15136 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Why do people sometimes abruptly become a better version of themselves?

He wanted to understand why this happens and ask how someone might attempt a similar transformation.</p><p> I&#39;ve witnessed this kind of personality change in others several times, so I believe the phenomenon is real. A number of my friends suddenly became much more motivated, conscientious, organized and ambitious—often translating into better life outcomes for themselves.</p><p> It&#39;s also something I&#39;ve personally experienced. When I was around fifteen, I changed my diet, started waking up early, exercising regularly, reading books and trying various ways to be more productive. While the transition took place over a couple of years rather than a singular moment, it still a rather abrupt directional change in my personality that has culminated in who I am today. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p> Assuming, for a second, that my introspective self-report and anecdotal observations are accurate, I think the reader&#39;s question is important and merits further discussion. Why do people sometimes abruptly become better versions of themselves? Perhaps more importantly, why does it so often seem to fail?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Discovering Self-Actualization</h2><p> For lack of a better term, I&#39;ll call this kind of transformation discovering self-actualization. That sounds vague, but it&#39;s the best way I can describe the experience. If you&#39;re allergic to self-help jargon, perhaps another way of describing it might be “becoming an adult” or “getting your act together.” </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> In my case, I think the changes were triggered by a fundamental restructuring of my belief system. Namely, I began to believe that there is considerable room for autonomy in making decisions over my life and that, if I chose wisely, those decisions could make a big difference in where my life ended up.</p><p> Wanting to start my own business was also a significant trigger. Something about the intrinsic appeal of being my own boss and having complete financial independence, combined with the inherent difficulty in succeeding in that goal, acted as a catalyst. Indeed, I&#39;ve known quite a few people who have discovered self-actualization in the context of professional ambition.</p><p> For other people, the trigger was something more concrete. They read a particular book that changed their worldview ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> , for many). They encountered a new-to-them religion, philosophy or spiritual practice ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a> seems to be another common trigger for change).</p><p> Even if the exact cause is idiosyncratic, I see a few common features:</p><ul><li> <strong>A belief that there are lives better than the one we are currently living.</strong> The central premise is that there&#39;s a broad array of possible futures, and many of them are better than the default. This seems to hold even in philosophical views that reject most kinds of ambition. For instance, those interested in mindfulness meditation often spurn the idea that career ambitions should be made central to life. But they still believe that mindfulness will let them experience a better quality of life.</li><li> <strong>A sudden, pervasive increase in self-efficacy.</strong> While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura&#39;s original concept</a> was decidedly granular, there do appear to be moments where you become more confident in succeeding at a broader range of actions.</li><li> <strong>Increased valuation of delaying gratification and resisting impulses.</strong> The willingness to work hard, do things that make you feel uncomfortable and resist your immediate habits and impulses is also at work. Over a relatively short period, someone who might have struggled with sticking to an exercise program is suddenly taking on dozens of high-effort challenges.</li><li> <strong>(Over)zealous application of the above changes.</strong> Often, people who experience a major paradigm shift are overly optimistic about the value of alternate versions of their life, overly confident about their ability to execute, and overly focused on self-improvement over momentary gratification.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Skeptic&#39;s Critique</h2><p> Of course, I&#39;m far from the first to notice this phenomenon. A lot of self-help gurus have built their entire marketing empires around selling people transformative life change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">Tony Robbins</a> , in particular, seems to make a big deal about these kinds of moments.</p><p> The skeptic would argue that these kinds of changes don&#39;t typically last. Hype fades, and while getting excited about something is easy, we rarely change our personality or behavior permanently.</p><p> I tend to agree with the skeptic—most of the time. I suspect that most people experience one or, maybe, two of these shifts in their entire life. Many people may never experience it. Change, instead, is generally gradual and directionless. Sometimes we get in a bit better shape, sometimes we let ourselves go. Most bursts of self-improvement revert to the mean.</p><p> However, given the significance of these dramatic shifts, we shouldn&#39;t round their probability to zero. Experiencing such a moment once or twice in your life might make up for dozens of other fizzled attempts at bettering yourself.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Does it Happen? Why Does it Fail?</h2><p> My speculative theory of these kinds of personal transformations is:</p><ul><li> <strong>There&#39;s a temporary change in your optimism, confidence and valuing of effort.</strong> This kind of momentary effect can come from reading a self-help book, having a role model who inspires you to work at something, or having a private epiphany.</li><li> <strong>The environment creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.</strong> The easiest way to see this kind of positive feedback loop would be setting a goal, achieving it, and suddenly biasing your other estimates of self-efficacy or confidence upward.</li><li> <strong>Once the initial feedback loop wears off, you&#39;re already in a sufficiently “different” position for your life.</strong> Your habits and material circumstances of personal identity have shifted to a new equilibrium position, and you now maintain it.</li></ul><p> Under this theory, most self-improvement efforts fizzle because the momentary burst of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, and the equilibrium you reach is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">metastable</a> . Eventually you decay back to the person you were before because a lot of gravity is pulling you back that way.</p><p> Even when this kind of transformative change occurs, I think there are probably limits on how far it can go. People&#39;s <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">beliefs about their malleability</a> vary wildly around the actual figure. Some people suddenly become incredibly optimistic about their ability to become popular, successful, smart, enlightened, etc., as well as the converse, where people adopt a fixed view of themselves and believe change is impossible.</p><p> The transformations I&#39;ve witnessed in other people tend to involve modestly unrealistic beliefs. This raises an interesting question of whether some amount of self-delusion helps in crossing over into a new equilibrium, even if it&#39;s unsustainable. Were that true, though much-maligned by skeptics, this small break from reality may actually be key—a truly sober assessment of one&#39;s possibilities may not encourage enough of a transitory change in your beliefs to shift over to a new equilibrium.</p><p> At the same time, it also seems clear that most changes are not of this magnitude. Discovering that you can take charge of your life is probably something you can only really do once or twice in your life. Once that&#39;s firmly established in your beliefs, further adjustments are probably minor in comparison—tweaks to your habits, skills or perspective.</p><p> Since the world is flush with people pitching and persuading others to adopt a self-actualization belief set (even if it is partly delusional), a related question is why such transformations are relatively rare. My suspicion is that they&#39;re harder to sustain because while it&#39;s easy to find sources of inspiration, it&#39;s much harder to locate the positive feedback loops that keep the motivation going.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Can You Trigger a Change in Yourself?</h2><p> Given that many of us would like to have a sudden, positive shift in the direction of our lives, is there anything we can do to facilitate this kind of transition? </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。 While I&#39;ve witnessed it many times, the change itself happens as a by-product of something else rather than the person actively seeking it out.</p><p> However, I do think there are a few generic ingredients that may increase the likelihood of such a change:</p><ul><li> <strong>Success with self-set ambitions.</strong> Self-efficacy seems to be a crucial motivational component here. It&#39;s not enough to know that building a business, learning a language or getting in shape is possible. You have to believe <em>you</em> could do it. While achieving one thing doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to across-the-board motivation, having more success is likely to encourage increased self-efficacy.</li><li> <strong>Reading a lot of books with inspiring-but-credible messages.</strong> If modest self-delusion plays a role in initiating these transitions, the temporary boost you get from reading motivational material may increase your chances of hitting an inflection point. But inspiration fails if you don&#39;t believe it. Hence, finding optimistic sources that seem credible to you is more important than just picking the cheesiest self-help title.</li><li> <strong>Finding challenging, worthwhile goals.</strong> At least in my own case, I felt like the desire to start a business was a catalyst. The combination of an attractive goal and knowing I wouldn&#39;t succeed unless I worked really hard seemed vital.</li><li> <strong>More randomness.</strong> A final catalyst is having experiences that take you outside your comfort zone. The idea here is that greater variability in your day-to-day experience increases the likelihood of stumbling upon a positive feedback loop that alters your course in life.</li></ul><p> In the end, I&#39;m not entirely sure why some people become obsessed with personal productivity, mindfulness meditation, exercising daily, building a business or becoming a straight-A student. I don&#39;t know why the direction of their life seems to pivot abruptly after a particular experience. But I agree with the reader who emailed me that even if such transitions are rare, they seem important and poorly understood.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/">Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 04:41:23 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15111 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> My pick for the best ten books on learning how to learn better!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/">Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What are the best books to read to become a better learner?

Today, I&#39;m rounding up some of those suggestions and trying to synthesize the advice for when (and when not) to use these tools for learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs</h2><p> Using applications like ChatGPT requires some care.</p><p> Part of the difficulty is that ChatGPT&#39;s human-like conversation abilities can be deceptive. Feeling like you&#39;re talking to a real person encourages you to rely on conversational expectations that may not hold with a machine.</p><p> For instance, we generally expect that most people do not make up facts. Large language models, however, routinely violate this expectation by providing fluent answers that may be totally wrong. The metacognitive ability to know what you don&#39;t know is underdeveloped in these applications.</p><p> Another expectation we have is that verbal fluency tracks other aspects of intelligence. We expect that someone who can spout lines from Shakespeare, explain quantum computing, and give a proof of the prime number theorem in rhyming verse would also be able to count. Thus, naively treating LLMs like a really smart and knowledgeable person is likely to backfire.</p><p> Those caveats aside, ChatGPT is clearly helpful for a range of tasks. Simon Willison suggests thinking of LLMs as a “ <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/">calculator for words</a> ”—something that can do useful things with text—rather than as a general-purpose intelligence or smart person.</p><p> I tend to agree. The more we can distinguish the cases where LLMs work well from where they don&#39;t (yet), the more we&#39;ll be able to take advantage of the new capabilities without falling into unexpected traps.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Ten Useful Learning Strategies with ChatGPT</h2><p> After receiving dozens of emails from my audience on how they have been personally using ChatGPT to learn, I&#39;ve compiled some tips with some of the most common suggestions.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Create your own Socratic tutor.</h3><p> By far, the most common use readers reported was using an LLM as a personal tutor.</p><p> Asking ChatGPT to explain tricky concepts, unfamiliar code or problems seems like an area where LLMs might do alright. And the only reasonable substitute (a human expert) is notoriously expensive and in short supply.</p><p> If you do this in conjunction with a class or textbook, the risks of mistakes also seem attenuated since you still have a primary source to compare against. Challenge explanations that don&#39;t jive with what you&#39;ve read in the book rather than taking everything the AI says at face value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Practice chatting in new languages.</h3><p> The next most common way people used LLMs to learn better was as a language tutor. This seems like a task LLMs are well-equipped for. Whatever their other flaws, they can produce grammatically correct text.</p><p> Many people set up their conversations with ChatGPT so that the AI could go back and forth between the language they are learning and English explanations when they got confused. Likely, those explanations may be imperfect, but human tutors also often give incorrect accounts of the grammar and vocabulary they manage to use proficiently.</p><p> Another use is rewriting texts to be at a more beginner-friendly level of reading comprehension. Graded readers and comprehensive input are great strategies for learning to read in another language. Unfortunately, learner materials are often sparse or uninteresting. You can use an LLM to transform a text you want to read that is written at a fluent native level into something appropriate for your current ability.</p><p> Duolingo seems to be getting in on the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">LLM game as well</a> . I&#39;ve been harsh on the drag-and-drop style of language learning used in earlier versions, but these new advances may force me to revise my opinion.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Generate summaries of longer texts.</h3><p> Summaries are another area where LLMs seem to excel. Consumer applications already exist for <a href="https://consensus.app/">generating summaries</a> of journal articles or research topics.</p><p> Several readers said they were using these AI tools to provide digests of their substantial reading material, helping them keep atop new developments in their field.</p><p> Good summaries, especially those fine-tuned to your particular needs, might be a good way of navigating the large information loads we often face in knowledge work. You could use it to help prioritize which documents to read in-depth or do a first pass organizing unfamiliar material. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15095" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-768x366.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1536x732.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary.jpg 1619w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> It looks like ChatGPT is not able to open links to summarize directly, but it often does a reasonable job hallucinating with famous texts like the one I used above. Until this functionality is standard in the consumer application, it&#39;s better to copy+paste.</p></blockquote><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Dialog with long documents.</h3><p> LLMs also can help you “ask questions” of longer texts. For instance, when reading a scientific paper you could quickly query the sample size or ask for the methodology or results. <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a> does this while offering references, so the risk of mistakes seems reduced when you can easily double-check the LLM&#39;s work.</p><p> While there are more fanciful usages here, such as people asking ChatGPT to impersonate a given writer and dialog with them, I suspect the ability to ask natural-language questions of documents and receive replies with references is a useful tool for dealing with large texts.</p><p> That said, you must be prepared to fact-check the LLM&#39;s answers. For instance, in the dialog captured below, I asked ChatGPT to list evidence supporting strongly-guided instruction, and it cited a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.59.1.14">review article by Mayer</a> . But it falsely claimed Mayer&#39;s work was a meta-analysis, which it isn&#39;t. In fact, the paper isn&#39;t even a comprehensive literature review but simply looks at three prominent cases of the failure of discovery learning. If taken at face value, this response can potentially mislead, but it&#39;s relatively easy to “check” the AI&#39;s work if you know what text it is transforming. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="745" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15096" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1536x1118.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog.jpg 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. Rewrite texts at different levels of explanatory depth.</h3><p> A major difficulty in following expert thinking is that most expert-level text is written for other experts. Concepts are unexplained, context is lacking and jargon abounds. This means that most people must rely on translators, such as general-market nonfiction or science writers, who present what experts think in a more readable format.</p><p> There seem to be two approaches to using AI tools here. One is simply asking an LLM to explain a popular concept in simpler terms, such as: “Explain quantum computing like I&#39;m an eighth-grader.” The other is to provide ChatGPT with a text or explanation and ask the AI to rewrite it in a more digestible manner.</p><p> I tend to think the latter is a little more reliable since you have the source material to compare with rather than taking ChatGPT&#39;s word for it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. Clear up unfamiliar jargon.</h3><p> Several years ago, I remember reading Tyler Cowen&#39;s <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution blog</a> and being perplexed by his frequent, unexplained use of the term “Straussian” to describe ideas or other thinkers. I Googled for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.</p><p> After a lot of research, I understood the term as meaning, roughly, “closely reading between the lines in prominent thinkers&#39; ideas, looking for what they really meant but couldn&#39;t always express because of prevailing censorship and intellectual orthodoxy.”</p><p> Had ChatGPT existed during my confusion, I could have just gotten this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="422" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15097" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x124.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x316.png 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1536x632.png 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> Many readers found similar benefits in using LLMs to figure out jargon and terms used within a particular community in a way that dictionary definitions often fail to elucidate.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Create study plans and agendas.</h3><p> This usage surprised me, but it showed up enough times among reader replies that I include it here. People seem to like using AI to tell them how and when to learn.</p><p> For instance, some readers asked ChatGPT to break down a complex learning goal and give them a curriculum. Others preferred to go even further, asking for ChatGPT to create a studying schedule for them, given their constraints for the day.</p><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t trust LLMs to give me a well-designed curriculum for a subject. But if I was learning something completely new, it might be a decent starting point. Sometimes the hardest part of approaching a new field is breaking down what appears to be an insurmountable goal. Similarly, sometimes being told when to study can help overcome the inertia of getting started.</p><p> While skill breakdowns might be alright, ChatGPT still struggles with creating reading lists, confabulating books and references. Thus, while it might do well for decomposing an ambiguous learning task, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to give me good resources (yet).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. Provide refreshers on forgotten or infrequently used tools.</h3><p> Programmers were the biggest professional group to reply to my query. I can&#39;t say whether this is because programming is uniquely well-suited to LLMs or because programmers, as a group, are more likely to adopt novel software tools.</p><p> The productivity advantages for programmers seem obvious. I don&#39;t write much code these days, so I haven&#39;t made much use of this well-publicized feature of LLMs. But since a lot of coding is relatively routine, the ability to have a machine create the first draft for an algorithm clearly saves a lot of time.</p><p> While there are cases of people with zero programming knowledge relying on AI output to build applications, I suspect these might be tricky to debug and maintain. In contrast, an expert programmer can override ChatGPT&#39;s output for a language he or she knows particularly well.</p><p> The place LLMs seem to work really well is at the fringes of a programmer&#39;s expertise. Many programmers told me that they found AI helpful in getting starting hints in unfamiliar languages or tools. Their base of programming experience allowed them to make sense of and implement the output, but their unfamiliarity with the underlying language meant the AI saved them a lot of time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. Generate flashcards based on text. (Tentative)</h3><p> Flashcards are a powerful learning tool. They&#39;re also a pain in the butt to make.</p><p> Some readers said they were using ChatGPT to generate flashcards for subjects they&#39;re studying. This seems well within the LLM abilities as a “calculator for words.” Thus, with the correct prompts, you could get fairly good results here—provided you&#39;re inputting the material you wish to see transformed into flashcards and not expecting the LLM to get the facts on its own (see below).</p><p> However, given the difficulty of making “good” flashcards, I wouldn&#39;t enter any into my Anki without reviewing them first. Nonetheless, making flashcards is tedious, so getting a first draft that I later review might speed up the process considerably. The risks seem relatively limited if you confirm the cards&#39; correctness before putting them in your deck.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. Use it to organize your notes. (Advanced)</h3><p> As someone who does a lot of research, I often waste a lot of time trying to locate my notes. Robert Martin finds the same problem. Searching via keywords is fraught because sometimes you can&#39;t remember the exact term you used, even if the meaning is roughly the same.</p><p> Martin <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2023/02/05/gpt-for-second-brain/">solves this problem</a> by using the embedding feature of LLMs. While not strictly ChatGPT, this tool from the same family of natural language processing techniques allows you to find semantically-related notes rather than exact keyword matches.</p><p> Personalized LLMs that live on your hard drive and access your existing data may be a valuable application. I&#39;d love to be able to search things I know I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t quite recall where.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Things NOT To Do</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Don&#39;t expect AI to get facts right.</h3><p> LLMs frequently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">make stuff up</a> . These hallucinations are problematic if you depend on ChatGPT to give correct answers. The prevalence of these mistakes is difficult to say right now. When Wikipedia was released, for instance, “experts” were in an uproar about how the user-generated nature of the website meant it couldn&#39;t ever be relied upon as a source. Except Wikipedia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438900a">actually does fairly well</a> , and some of these knee-jerk reactions were misplaced.</p><p> LLMs haven&#39;t reached Wikipedia&#39;s quality in terms of facts, and we still don&#39;t know much about when they&#39;re likely to get an answer right and when they&#39;re likely to make stuff up. For now, it seems best to use them for situations where the cost of an incorrect answer is minimal, either because you can look it up in a verified source, or because your use of the AI for isn&#39;t factual in nature.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Don&#39;t expect AI to get citations right.</h3><p> While LLMs sometimes mess up facts, they seem abysmal at getting citations right. They frequently invent authors, papers, studies and research.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t use a LLM for any research that I needed to cite, and I would always double-check the sources it does provide.</p><p> Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t ask an LLM to give me a reading list or references to specific books or authors (unless, possibly, the authors were quite famous and likely to be well-represented in the data set).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Don&#39;t expect AI to get the math right.</h3><p> I believe it&#39;s a mistake to attribute general intelligence to LLMs based on their ability to do many tasks at a human level or beyond. As with chess bots and image classifiers, the technology behind LLMs is extremely narrow compared to what we would expect of a human who scored similarly on verbal tests.</p><p> One finding from psychology is that much of reasoning is performed by different subsystems in the brain than those devoted to language. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">This paper</a> argues that LLMs seem to match the neurological evidence from double-dissociation studies: you can have fluent verbal abilities with seriously impaired reasoning and vice versa.</p><p> As such, LLMs are really bad at math. And not just higher-level math that humans struggle with. LLMs often fail at <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt">basic counting tasks</a> . Thus I suspect LLMs would be uniquely bad at a task like providing practice problems for a math class and grading the answers. ChatGPT might be able to explain a math concept well, but be unreliable at actually using it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Have you used ChatGPT or other AI tools to further your learning?

However, before I share that post, I&#39;d like to address a different question.</p><p> One question a few readers have is whether ChatGPT will eliminate the need to learn things. After all, if you can easily ask the machine a question and it will spit out an expert-like answer, what&#39;s the point of getting students to write essays, memorize facts or try to remember a lot of knowledge?</p><p> Like everyone, I&#39;m gobsmacked by the performance of large language models like ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. That said, it&#39;s hard to predict things, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">especially about the future</a> . And I suspect the evolution of new AI tools is harder to predict than most things. We have poor intuitions about what sorts of problems machines can solve, and so the general discourse around AI as a field tends to swing between wild pessimism and optimism as we learn more about the path ahead.</p><p> One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won&#39;t make learning obsolete.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Learning Still Matters</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1521622480&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> One reason I can feel confident about the continued value of learning is that while ChatGPT is novel, the kind of technological change it has brought about is not.</p><p> Humans have been inventing technology that has replaced aspects of cognitive work for thousands of years. In every case, the result of that substitution was not a diminishing of the need for skills and knowledge—but an increase.</p><p> Consider the impact of writing. Human knowledge used to be transmitted orally. When writing became available, thinkers such as Socrates decried the damage it would do to people&#39;s memory. We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down.</p><p> Or consider calculators, which have been widespread for decades. You probably have one on your smartphone. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p><p> A robust finding in educational psychology is the importance of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Why-Knowledge-Matters-Rescuing-Educational/dp/1612509525/ref=asc_df_1612509525/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=296035595995&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17947244405290068344&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001551&amp;hvtargid=pla-464465047333&amp;psc=1">background knowledge</a> . People who know more about a subject can understand and retain more of what they read. Knowledge outside your head doesn&#39;t count, since it can&#39;t participate in learning and reasoning.</p><p> Similarly, even if you use a calculator all the time, you understand math better when you first learn to do it by hand. Working through low-level calculations creates conceptual and procedural skills that build an intuitive sense for the underlying algorithms. While you can save effort by using a calculator, the intuition you gained from your initial learning helps you recognize if the calculation is correct and how to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p> The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Will ChatGPT Change What Knowledge Matters?</h2><p> So perhaps we can safely reject the extreme position that learning will become obsolete. Won&#39;t LLMs change what <em>kind</em> of knowledge is worth learning?</p><p> This is probably the case. But it&#39;s not obvious to me what the transition will be, and I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s intuitions on this are correct either.</p><p> The gut reaction seems to be that since large language models can easily spit out an explanation to any question answerable within the sphere of well-documented human knowledge, LLMs devalue this kind of book learning.</p><p> Even putting aside the hallucinations and failings of current LLMs and assuming engineers perfect the technology to the point where it rarely gets these questions wrong, I&#39;m not sure this intuition is correct.</p><p> As mentioned in the research on background knowledge, your ability to ask a useful question and then understand an LLM&#39;s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess. For instance, economist and polymath Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/what-is-the-single-best-way-of-improving-your-gpt-prompts.html">argues</a> that asking an economics question to ChatGPT goes better if you ask it to answer in the style of Milton Friedman or Paul Krugman. Your own economics knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a new phenomenon. If the answers to all the world&#39;s questions were already on the Internet, but you didn&#39;t know where to look, they&#39;d be invisible to you.</p><p> Contrary to the supposition that book learning will be less relevant, I suspect that it will be <em>more</em> important. The people who get the most programming help from ChatGPT are existing programmers—since their knowledge allows them to ask well-formulated programming questions and accurately assess the results. LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Subjects/Skills are Still Worth Learning?</h2><p> A few people wrote to me wondering whether it even makes sense to learn second languages, programming, creative writing or art, given the ever-increasing powers of these applications.</p><p> My feeling is that, on the whole, the value of these skills hasn&#39;t changed much. What will probably change is the differential value of mastery versus novice levels of various skills. There may be fewer professional opportunities available for mediocre programmers, writers, artists or translators. This kind of skill polarization has been going on for a long time, as I documented in my book <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . ChatGPT is just a continuation of current trends.</p><p> But just as there&#39;s a diminished value for someone who can crank out stock art or kludge together a website, there&#39;s probably increased value for those sophisticated enough to use these tools in collaboration with their professional expertise.</p><p> What if we get genuinely general artificial intelligence? An application so advanced it can perform any cognitive task better than a person, or indeed, better than a person in collaboration with a machine? Chess seems to provide an illustrative example, with top chess engines picking better moves than top players—even those who have access to top chess engines.</p><p> In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we&#39;ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we&#39;ll all get <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">turned into paperclips</a> . Who knows?</p><p> But, despite the uncertain long-term forecast, I&#39;m fairly confident that the short-to-medium-term impact of tools like ChatGPT will not be to devalue learning complex skills and knowledge, but will actually increase the value of these activities. As with other technological advances that have come before, it will be the quick and enthusiastic learners who reap the benefits.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/">No, ChatGPT Doesn&#39;t Mean You Don&#39;t Need to Learn Things</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15058 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A summary of my views on how transfer of learning works, based on research.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Transfer occurs when learning one thing helps you learn or do something else. It&#39;s arguably the most important issue in educational psychology. After all, we spend years in the classroom. One would hope the things we learn make us more productive on the job, conscientious as citizens or intelligent in our daily lives.</p><p> Yet it turns out the titular question is really difficult to answer. This is because the answer depends on three different questions, each of which is itself incredibly complicated:</p><ol><li> How do we perform skills?</li><li> How do we acquire them?</li><li> What sorts of skills are used in real life?</li></ol><p> About two years ago, I started a research project to learn everything I could about transfer. It quickly became clear that understanding transfer depended on answering the other three questions, so my research broadened drastically.</p><p> Despite two years of research and a lot of writing about transfer (including a chapter of <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> ), I still don&#39;t have a definitive answer for how much transfer we can expect. But I&#39;d like to share at least how I&#39;ve come to think about the issue.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question One: How Do We Perform Skills?</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1534327468%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-juyTV0wYgXx&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> Essentially, transfer is a product of overlap. We should expect transfer from one skill to another when something in those two skills is essentially the same. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15068" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Nearly every well-articulated theory of transfer is an overlap theory. What differs between theories is the “something” which potentially overlaps. Let&#39;s consider some candidates:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad mental faculties.</strong> In <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/formal-discipline">this framework</a> , “reasoning” or “memory” overlap across different skills. This theory likens the mind to a muscle that can be strengthened through many types of practice. This would suggest transfer is quite broad and that almost any strenuous mental activity should produce benefits.</li><li> <strong>Stimulus-response.</strong> Perhaps, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorists</a> , the mind is merely a collection of habits, stimulus leading inevitably to response? This view would suggest transfer is extraordinarily limited—every superficial change in a situation would require a new skill.</li><li> <strong>Propositions and productions.</strong> Theories like <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/02/15/act-r/">ACT-R</a> argue that our brains store skills in essentially two forms: small chunks of factual knowledge and simple component procedures. Complex skills and knowledge are simply aggregates of these foundational pieces.</li><li> <strong>Schemas.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">Schema-based theories</a> claim that knowledge is organized in patterns larger than individual actions or chunks. These patterns roughly correspond to “templates” with both fixed and variable components. For instance, we might have a “birthday party” schema that includes birthday cake and presents, but only optionally clowns or pointy paper hats.</li><li> <strong>Neural networks.</strong> The brain is made out of neurons, and we have some idea of how those neurons process information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">Connectionist</a> theories take these basic neuronal properties as a starting point and posit theories of learning based on them. Teasing out implications for transfer is harder here, but it would most likely look like an overlap in the synaptic connectivity between two skills.</li><li> <strong>Activity systems.</strong> Perhaps transfer isn&#39;t in our heads but is a property of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">broader social and physical environments</a> ? In this view, the person relies on their environment to perform a skill, and transfer fails when those environmental supports are altered.</li></ul><p> Only the first two seem to be demonstrably false. The <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/09/13/brain-training-doesnt-work/">mind is not like a muscle</a> , nor is it a simplistic stimulus-response device.</p><p> I find the information-processing perspective of cognitive science to be the most persuasive. The mind is essentially computational (although quite different from computers made out of transistors). Answering the question of transfer depends on how the algorithms for skills are composed.</p><p> From this perspective, what seems safe to say is that skills can only reliably influence each other if they overlap in either their procedures or knowledge. If two skills don&#39;t use the same process, and the knowledge they depend on is different, there shouldn&#39;t be much (if any) transfer.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15058' title="I’m leaving aside analogies. Analogies suggest two domains that have nothing to do with each other may actually be a source of transfer. But another way of saying this is that analogies suggest an abstract commonality between two superficially different domains. When analogies are useful, they tend to share an overlapping deep structure, so I would include them as an &amp;#8220;overlap&amp;#8221; theory, even if the overlap is an active process rather than the nature of the mental representations themselves."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Two: How Do We Acquire Skills?</h2><p> How the mind represents skills is only one part of understanding transfer. There&#39;s also the issue of how we acquire these representations. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15069" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Here, a few things seem pertinent:</p><ul><li> <strong>Expert-novice differences.</strong> Experts appear to represent ideas at a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220480253_Categorization_and_Representation_of_Physics_Problems_by_Experts_and_Novices">deeper level than novices</a> . The most likely explanation is that skills become more abstract as we encounter more examples and learn to generalize and distinguish concepts.</li><li> <strong>Automaticity effects</strong> . Skills tend to recede from conscious awareness with experience. There are many different proposed mechanisms for this in psychology, but a consequence seems to be that how the expert <em>thinks</em> they perform a skill may not fully capture what they&#39;re actually doing.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15058' title="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Read-Thinking-Learning-about/dp/0262510766/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678392728&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;science on reading&lt;/a>; seems relevant here: careful experimentation seems to indicate that fluent readers decode words letter-by-letter, even though we may feel like we recognize meaning holistically as we look at text."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li> <strong>Mnemonic effects.</strong> Another complication is that even if there is no overlap between two skills in expert performance, there might be an overlap at an earlier stage of acquisition. Vimla Patel has explored this in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10401338909539394?journalCode=htlm20">medical cognition</a> . She comments on the finding that basic science tends to be used infrequently in clinical practice. However, that doesn&#39;t mean learning basic science is useless for doctors because it forms a scaffolding for making sense of clinical knowledge, thus aiding in its acquisition.</li><li> <strong>Declarative-to-procedural transitions.</strong> Another characteristic progression in learning is for skills to start as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a> —things we know and think about explicitly—and shift to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">procedural knowledge</a> —actions we take automatically. This transformation implies that skills may have different patterns of transfer at different levels of mastery as their dominant mental representation changes.</li><li> <strong>Cognitive load.</strong> Different training activities work better for <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">different stages of skill acquisition and working memory capacity</a> . Studying an example, for instance, is better than solving a problem when cognitive load is high, but the opposite is true when cognitive load is low. Efficiency of practice, then, is more than just a question of overlap but also of the stage of learning. Early on, drills, practice on component skills and structured lessons are more helpful. Later on, complex, realistic practice matters more.</li></ul><p> On top of these psychological details, there&#39;s the issue of pedagogy. There are often multiple methods for teaching something. Those methods have varying levels of generality and can apply to a broader or narrower range of concepts. Transfer, then, also depends on how something is taught.</p><p> My sense from reading this research is that there are a few pitfalls to avoid:</p><ul><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer potential by the abilities of novices.</strong> Novices have a more superficial, context-bound understanding. That&#39;s more indicative of their phase of skill acquisition than the ultimate potential for transfer.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer on one-shot problem-solving tests.</strong> Problems often require many pieces of knowledge and procedures to solve correctly. Failure in the tested task could mean a complete failure of transfer, or it could mean that a person is 99% of the way there but still missing one piece. A better test is to train a person on task A, then on task B, and measure the time savings on B from the knowledge and skills acquired in A.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t trust experts&#39; perceptions of how they do a task.</strong> Experts are<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Ourselves-Discovering-Adaptive-Unconscious/dp/0674013824">bad at introspecting</a> their cognitive procedures. We tend to underrate knowledge we&#39;ve already acquired, seeing it as obvious. The ease of automaticity fools us into thinking the complex skills we perform are simple.

Few studies have looked systematically at the kinds of cognitive skills people regularly employ at work and at home.</p><p> Critics allege that much of what we learn in school has little real-world application.</p><p> John Anderson <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Memory-Integrated-John-Anderson/dp/0471249254">reports</a> that employers either want very basic skills (which the educational system should already be teaching) or highly specific skills that no universal curriculum could aspire to. Similarly, Peter Cappelli <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Good-People-Cant-Jobs/dp/B00FJUFFD8/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Smadj&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_p=22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_r=138-5005353-2745032&amp;pd_rd_wg=vgzAZ&amp;pd_rd_r=36883576-42ee-403e-89ee-0ccca61e0046&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk">argues</a> that surveys show employers tend not to highly value academic skills.</p><p> Jean Lave <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cognition-Practice-Mathematics-Culture-Everyday/dp/0521357349/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UHF1GP7YERE1&amp;keywords=jean+lave+cognition+in+practice&amp;qid=1681499209&amp;sprefix=jean+lave+cognition+in+practic%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-2">found</a> that the mathematics taught in school is rarely what people use in their daily routines.</p><p> Bryan Caplan <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652">argues</a> that much of education is signaling—showing others we have smarts, conformity and work-ethic—rather than cultivating those abilities. From this perspective, the real purpose of schools is to sort people, not to teach useful skills. School knowledge doesn&#39;t apply to real life, Caplan argues, because that&#39;s not the function it serves in society.</p><p> Supporters of education argue that just because most skills aren&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re useless. We may become specialists of one sort or another, but unless we assign everyone a career at birth, we want to maintain maximum flexibility until our adult years. A side-effect of this desire to maintain flexibility is that we end up learning a lot that we don&#39;t ever end up using, or that is insufficiently concrete to apply in practice without further training.</p><p> Similarly, education proponents <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mindware-Tools-for-Smart-Thinking/dp/B0719GQ4GZ/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=284313338521&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9001556&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=15299944356742459999&amp;hvtargid=kwd-314760458336&amp;hydadcr=14950_9480932&amp;keywords=mindware+nisbett&amp;qid=1681499263&amp;sr=8-1">point out</a> that just because a skill isn&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be. Statistics is a powerful tool for reasoning about many important issues. The fact that people are statistically naive shows we should be teaching them more, not declaring it impotent!</p><p> Whether we apply a skill in a new context depends on the effort it requires. Practice can lower the effort of applying a skill in real life and create more situations where it is convenient to use. Imagine rewinding time to before widespread literacy; it would be perverse to argue that reading isn&#39;t useful because most people don&#39;t read.</p><p> My perspective is that, while many academic subjects aren&#39;t used, it&#39;s difficult to appreciate a subject until you learn it. Given that we generally cannot “infer” a domain of knowledge simply by encountering problems that apply it, this argument favors accumulating more knowledge than you think you&#39;ll need.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Side Note: Transfer of Effort, Motivation and “Noncognitive” Skills</h2><p> Thus far I&#39;ve been looking at transfer through a cognitive lens. A somewhat separate issue is the transfer of things like the ability to focus and study for long periods of time, the ability to resist temptations, or the motivation to want to learn.</p><p> Many of the same arguments used above apply to noncognitive skills as well. There&#39;s unlikely to be something like a general faculty you can improve with bulk training efforts for motivation, persistence or focus.</p><p> That said, the arguments about transfer here are somewhat different because these are not complex skills (in the information processing sense of “complex”). Sitting at your desk and focusing for eight hours may be difficult, but it&#39;s not <em>computationally</em> demanding.</p><p> Thus while I think it&#39;s ridiculous to imagine improving your memory by memorizing Latin verbs, it&#39;s not ridiculous to imagine improving your ability to focus by regularly sitting down to focus. Believing that cognitive skills are highly specific, and should show limited transfer, is not logically incompatible with a more general transfer of effort or persistence. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15071" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I might write a fuller summary of my views later, but I want to clarify that while “speaking French” and “being able to focus” are both discussed as skills, they have a different locus of difficulty. French is hard because there are lots of words, grammar and mental processes you need to perform it. Focusing is hard because the naive reward center of your brain wants to go on Twitter instead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Summarizing My Thoughts on Transfer</h2><p> If you take one thing from this article, it should be that transfer is complicated.</p><p> As a practical takeaway, I would agree with roughly the following:</p><ul><li> Transfer should be minimal between unrelated skills.</li><li> Transfer between related subjects depends on how much they overlap in content and procedures, with the caveat that those content and procedures may extend beyond what is traditionally thought of as the curriculum.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15058' title="For instance, I tend to think learning Chinese will help with later learning Spanish, even though there is virtually no overlap in the vocabulary or syntax. Instead, what is transferred is a more abstract understanding of languages and how they are learned."><sup>3</sup></a></span></li><li> Academic subjects can transfer to real life, but this transfer can fail because:<ul><li> We are missing components of the skill for applying it. This can include “recognizing” when an academically learned skill applies (for instance, applying algebra to a real-life quantitative problem).</li><li> We haven&#39;t automated the skill enough to pass the cost-benefit threshold.</li><li> We can&#39;t actually perform the skill with only our academic ability.</li><li> Many academic skills are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_knowledge">inert</a> , but they&#39;re still potentially helpful for accelerating learning that builds upon them.</li></ul></li><li> All else being equal, practice on more cognitively similar tasks should maximize overlap and, thus, future transfer. However, there are important exceptions to this because of cognitive load, retrieval effects and overall difficulty. Therefore identifying the most beneficial practice activity may be more complicated than simply matching it with the activity you&#39;re trying to get good at.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15058' title="This is a major misconception I had when I wrote my “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/&quot;>;do the real thing&lt;/a>;” piece."><sup>4</sup></a></span></li></ul><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
