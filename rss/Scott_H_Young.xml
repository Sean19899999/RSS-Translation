</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>学习计划组织三件事：</p><ol><li>你必须学习什么。</li><li>你将如何学习它。</li><li>当你打算投资的时候。</li></ol><p>虽然听起来很简单，但大多数学生并没有制定详细的学习计划。在那些这样做的人中，他们经常犯错误，使计划非常不切实际——这是未来内疚的良方，而不是未来的学习。</p><p>在这篇文章中，我将概述如何制定学习计划——以及如何坚持下去。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么要制定学习计划？</h2><p>学习是努力的。虽然这种努力可能很愉快，但我们当下想做什么的冲动往往与最大化学习的事情不一致。事实上，研究表明，学生经常<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">选择感觉有趣但没有成果的活动</a>。</p><p>一个很好的类比是运动。虽然参加一项运动或慢跑可能很有趣，但我们的大脑旨在避免不必要的体力消耗。这就是为什么你很少看到 10 岁以上的人在街上奔跑，除非他们约会迟到。</p><p>如果您想在不伤害自己的情况下锻炼身体，那么制定一个您可以并且会坚持的锻炼计划会有所帮助，而不是只要您愿意就去健身房并使用您偶然发现的任何设备进行锻炼。</p><p>学习的逻辑是一样的。制定计划可以最大限度地增加在需要创造学习的地方投入精力的机会。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第一步：检查您的材料</h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg

/></figure><p>我假设您已经选择了一些课程、书籍、教程或其他课程来指导您。 （如果你还没有，第一步就是做你的研究并为你想要学习的技能找到一个好的资源！）</p><p>起点是回顾你的课程并弄清楚：</p><ul><li>您需要观看/阅读/复习哪些课程？</li><li>你需要从事哪些实践活动？</li><li>您需要完成哪些必需的可交付成果（论文/作业）？</li><li>您需要如何使用您获得的技能和知识？考虑期末考试的形式以及您计划将所学技能和知识应用到什么地方。</li></ul><p>纯练习项目可能是个例外。在此类项目中，您不是在处理材料，而是在尝试练习或实施您在其他地方获得的知识。对于练习项目，您正在创建自己的课程，因此您可以选择自己的进度。当你已经过了初学阶段时，这些往往会更成功，并且可以更成功地指导你自己的练习。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第二步：计算你的最少时间投资</h2><p>最短时间投入包括完成指定课程所需的所有工作。这包括：</p><ul><li>完成要求的阅读需要多长时间？</li><li>观看任何视频/讲座/课程需要多长时间？</li><li>完成所需的可交付成果（作业、论文、项目）需要多长时间？</li></ul><p>视频和录制的讲座很容易估算：您可以将所有视频的运行时间相加。你能<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">以更快的速度观看</a>吗？如果是这样，您可以将总数除以估计的播放速率（例如，1.5 或 2 倍速度）。否则，这个时间是根据课程的时长确定的。</p><p>对于必读，您需要估计您的阅读率。您可以通过计时自己阅读几页并将其推断到整本书来获得初步近似值。缓慢而刻意地阅读；长时间阅读的速度不可避免地比几分钟的冲刺要慢。</p><p>家庭作业很难提前估算，但您可以从课程提供者、老师或过去的学生那里得到估算。</p><p>这里的总体思路是计算在不进行任何额外学习的情况下完成所提供材料的最少时间投入。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第三步：估计额外的学习时间需求</h2><p>对于某些课程，只需完成所有分配的作业，您就可以通过测试并将其应用到现实生活中。但对于大多数课程，你必须超越这一点。</p><p>您可能希望投入时间的其他一些地方是：</p><ul><li>额外的练习题/作业。</li><li>应用于现实生活中的问题和环境。</li><li>创建/审查抽认卡。</li><li>自我解释，例如<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">费曼技巧</a>。</li><li>教学大纲中未提及的额外研究。</li></ul><p>估计这一点的一个好方法是查看您的个人历史数据：除了最低限度的课程之外，您通常需要投入多少时间才能达到您想要的课堂效果？这里没有“正确”的答案。有些课程是时间密集型的，所需的材料很难通过。其他课程很少，留给学生自己掌握材料。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第四步：在日历中安排学习</h2><p>一旦您有了预期时间投资的详细列表，您就需要弄清楚什么时候您才真正开始做每件事。</p><p>将任何截止日期、考试、现场讲座或课程直接放在您的日历中。对于阅读、做作业、练习等形式的学习，你仍然应该分配时间给它们，但有两种不同的方法：</p><ul><li><strong>最严格的选择是将所有事情安排为约会。</strong>如果学习必须适应已经很拥挤的时间表，我推荐这种方法。因此，如果您是一位忙碌的家长，并且是为执照考试学习的专业人士，您最好将学习时间直接放在您的日历中，否则它会立即被推到一边。</li><li><strong>更灵活的选择是创建每周或每天的例程。</strong>每个区块中的确切活动会根据您的目标而有所不同，但时间承诺本身将是相对常规的。例如，您可能决定每天早上上班前、晚上或周末学习。</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第五步：完整性检查</h2><p>在这个过程的这一点上，我们可以做一个基本的健全性检查：你从第二步和第三步计算的时间投入与你计划的时间相比如何？如果您的项目可用时间少于估计的最小时间，那么您已经有一个非启动器。您需要在您的日程安排中腾出更多时间，重新考虑学习项目的目标，或者延长您允许完成它的时间表。</p><p>如果您的可用时间略多于您的预算，那么您几乎没有犯错的余地。生病、一个意想不到的具有挑战性的话题或意外的中断都可能使整个项目脱轨。</p><p>如果您的可用时间比预算多得多，那不一定是放松的迹象。太松懈了，你可能会在需要学习的时候感觉不到压力，最终会浪费时间拖延。在这些情况下，我建议设置软截止日期，将工作提前到更宽松的时间表。这种方法可以让压力保持舒适但具有挑战性，因此您以后有更多的错误空间。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第六步：获得反馈</h2><p>制定计划是比较容易的部分。困难的部分是坚持下去。幸运的是，如果你在学习时留意你得到的反馈并相应地进行调整，你制定的计划将是一个非常宝贵的指南，而不是在第一次遇到困难时就被扔到一边的东西。</p><p>考虑这些反馈来源：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. 坚持你的日程安排的反馈。</h3><p>反馈的第一个来源是您执行计划的能力。一个有用的策略就是每天将您的意图写在议程或计划表上，然后记录您实际做了什么。例如，你可能打算在星期三学习三个小时，但你被打扰了，只学了两个小时。</p><p>每当与您的计划有偏差时，注意障碍的来源是有帮助的。即使您无法控制一切使您偏离计划的因素，但如果您能识别它们，那么几乎没有什么障碍是无法克服的。考虑：</p><ul><li><strong>由于他人的干扰而产生的偏差。</strong>沟通学习时间的界限，以便其他人理解它的重要性。如果您无法避免打扰，请在您的日程安排中找到后备学习时段，以弥补偶尔的、不可避免的打扰。</li><li><strong>准备不足造成的偏差。</strong>你的电脑坏了。您无法登录您的帐户来访问课程。你不得不买彩色铅笔。想办法在你预定的会议之前做这些事情，或者认为它们是不必要的。</li><li><strong>由于拖延/动机而导致的偏差。</strong>使用<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">番茄工作法</a>，降低您对会话熟练程度的期望以避免完美主义，或者在阅读/练习之间交替进行以避免走神或无聊。</li></ul><p>学习是费力的，真正的障碍可能会出现，因此很难坚持一个人的计划。但是，如果您能确定导致中断的原因，则在许多情况下都可以找到补救措施。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 学习进度反馈。</h3><p>第二个反馈来源与您的学习进度有关。有时技能和主题会立即融合，您不需要复习它们。在其他情况下，新材料可能看起来令人眼花缭乱，超出了您对掌握所需时间的估计。</p><p>再次重申，关键是观察反馈并将其分解：</p><ul><li><strong>您是否因为基础知识没有牢牢扎根而苦苦挣扎？</strong>练习、抽认卡和对简单问题的反复练习可以帮助解决这个问题。</li><li><strong>您是否因为不理解一个困难的想法而苦苦挣扎？</strong>自我解释、与老师/同龄人/导师交谈以及寻找其他解释来源可能会有所帮助。</li><li><strong>您是否因为看不到自己做错了什么或如何改进而苦苦挣扎？</strong>寻求指导、纠正性反馈或指导可能会有所帮助。</li></ul><p>您识别问题的粒度越细，它们就越容易解决。专注于特定的概念、动作、事实或程序是克服困难的关键。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第七步：进行修改</h2><p>获得一些反馈后，您可能需要修改计划。如果你落后了，这可能涉及增加你投入的时间，或者你可能会改变你的日常生活，这样你就可以真正投入你说的时间。</p><p>最后，你可能不会完全死板地坚持你的计划。计划的主要好处不是消除所有即兴创作和灵活性。相反，它是为了提前学习和识别障碍所需的时间和精力资源，这样你就可以避免大部分障碍。最终有用的不是计划本身，而是制定计划的想法。</p><p><a

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>一位读者给我发来电子邮件，列举了一些突然改变生活的人的例子：他们开始锻炼，养成更好的习惯，努力学习并取得好成绩，在他们的职业生涯中取得进步……基本上一夜之间就把自己变成了“成功”的人。他想了解为什么会发生这种情况，并询问人们如何尝试进行类似的转变。</p><p>我在其他人身上看到过几次这种性格变化，所以我相信这种现象是真实存在的。我的一些朋友突然变得更有动力、更认真、更有条理和更有野心——通常会为他们自己带来更好的生活成果。</p><p>这也是我亲身经历过的事情。当我大约十五岁时，我改变了饮食习惯，开始早起、定期锻炼、读书并尝试各种提高工作效率的方法。虽然转变发生在几年而不是一个单一的时刻，但它仍然是我性格中一个相当突然的方向变化，最终成就了今天的我。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p>暂时假设我的内省自我报告和轶事观察是准确的，我认为读者的问题很重要，值得进一步讨论。为什么人们有时会突然变成更好的自己？也许更重要的是，为什么它经常失败？</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">发现自我实现</h2><p>由于找不到更好的术语，我将这种转变称为发现自我实现。这听起来含糊不清，但这是我描述这种体验的最佳方式。如果您对自助行话过敏，也许另一种描述方式可能是“成为成年人”或“齐心协力”。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>就我而言，我认为这些变化是由我的信仰体系的根本重组引发的。也就是说，我开始相信在我的人生决定中有相当大的自主空间，而且如果我做出明智的选择，这些决定可能会对我的人生结局产生重大影响。</p><p>想要自己创业也是一个重要的触发因素。自己当老板和拥有完全的财务独立的内在吸引力，加上实现该目标的内在困难，起到了催化剂的作用。事实上，我认识不少人在职业抱负的背景下发现了自我实现。</p><p>对于其他人来说，触发器是更具体的东西。他们读了一本改变了他们世界观的书（对很多人来说是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> ）。他们遇到了一种新的宗教、哲学或精神实践（<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">正念冥想</a>似乎是另一种常见的改变触发因素）。</p><p>即使确切的原因是特殊的，我也看到了一些共同的特征：</p><ul><li><strong>相信有比我们现在生活更好的生活。</strong>中心前提是存在广泛的可能期货，其中许多优于默认。即使在拒绝大多数野心的哲学观点中，这似乎也成立。例如，那些对正念冥想感兴趣的人常常拒绝职业抱负应该成为生活中心的想法。但他们仍然相信正念会让他们体验到更好的生活质量。</li><li><strong>自我效能突然普遍提高。</strong>虽然<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura 最初的概念</a>非常精细，但似乎确实存在一些时刻，您会更有信心在更广泛的行动中取得成功。</li><li><strong>增加延迟满足和抵制冲动的价值。</strong>愿意努力工作、做让您感到不舒服的事情以及抵制您眼前的习惯和冲动的意愿也在起作用。在相对较短的时间内，可能难以坚持锻炼计划的人突然接受了数十项高强度挑战。</li><li> <strong>（过度）热心应用上述更改。</strong>通常，经历过重大范式转变的人对他们生活的替代版本的价值过于乐观，对自己的执行能力过于自信，并且过于关注自我提升而不是一时的满足。</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">怀疑论者的批判</h2><p>当然，我并不是第一个注意到这种现象的人。许多自助大师围绕向人们推销变革性的生活改变建立了他们的整个营销帝国。尤其是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">托尼·罗宾斯 (Tony Robbins)</a> ，似乎对这些时刻非常重视。</p><p>怀疑论者会争辩说，这些变化通常不会持久。炒作消退，虽然对某事感到兴奋很容易，但我们很少会永久改变我们的性格或行为。</p><p>我倾向于同意怀疑论者的观点——大多数时候。我怀疑大多数人一生中都会经历一次或两次这样的转变。很多人可能永远都没有经历过。相反，变化通常是渐进的、没有方向的。有时我们的状态会好一点，有时我们会放手。大多数自我提升的爆发都会回归到平均水平。</p><p>然而，考虑到这些戏剧性变化的重要性，我们不应该将它们的概率四舍五入为零。在你的生活中经历一两次这样的时刻可能会弥补许多其他失败的改善自己的尝试。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么会发生？为什么会失败？</h2><p>我对这些个人转变的推测理论是：</p><ul><li><strong>你的乐观、自信和努力的价值暂时发生了变化。</strong>这种瞬间的效果可能来自于阅读一本自助书籍，有一个激励你去做某事的榜样，或者有一个私人的顿悟。</li><li><strong>环境创造了一个自我维持的反馈循环。</strong>看到这种正反馈循环的最简单方法是设定一个目标，实现它，然后突然向上偏向你对自我效能或信心的其他估计。</li><li><strong>一旦最初的反馈循环消失，你的生活就已经处于一个足够“不同”的位置。</strong>你的习惯和个人身份的物质环境已经转移到一个新的平衡位置，你现在保持它。</li></ul><p>根据这一理论，大多数自我提升的努力都以失败告终，因为一时的热情爆发不会产生自我维持的反馈循环，而你达到的平衡是<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">亚稳态的</a>。最终你会变回原来的你，因为有很大的引力把你拉回到原来的样子。</p><p>即使发生了这种变革性的变化，我认为它能走多远也可能是有限的。人们<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">对其可塑性的看法</a>因实际数字而异。有些人突然对自己变得受欢迎、成功、聪明、开明等的能力变得难以置信地乐观，以及相反，人们对自己采取固定的看法，认为改变是不可能的。</p><p>我在其他人身上目睹的转变往往涉及适度不切实际的信念。这就提出了一个有趣的问题，即一定程度的自欺欺人是否有助于进入新的平衡状态，即使它是不可持续的。如果那是真的，虽然遭到怀疑论者的大肆抨击，但这种与现实的小突破实际上可能是关键——对一个人的可能性进行真正清醒的评估可能不足以鼓励你的信念发生短暂的改变，从而转向新的平衡。</p><p>与此同时，似乎也很明显，大多数变化都没有这么大。发现自己可以掌控自己的生活，这可能是您一生中只能真正做一两次的事情。一旦在你的信念中坚定地确立了这一点，相比之下进一步的调整可能是微不足道的——调整你的习惯、技能或观点。</p><p>由于世界上到处都是推销和说服他人采用自我实现信念集（即使它部分是妄想）的人，一个相关的问题是为什么这种转变相对罕见。我怀疑它们更难维持，因为虽然很容易找到灵感来源，但找到保持动力持续的积极反馈循环要困难得多。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">你能改变自己吗？</h2><p>鉴于我们中的许多人都希望我们的生活方向突然发生积极转变，我们可以做些什么来促进这种转变？ </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。虽然我已经多次亲眼目睹，但变化本身是其他事物的副产品，而不是积极寻求它的人。</p><p>但是，我确实认为有一些通用成分可能会增加这种变化的可能性：</p><ul><li><strong>成功与自我设定的抱负。</strong>在这里，自我效能感似乎是一个重要的激励因素。仅仅知道建立企业、学习语言或保持健康是可能的是不够的。你必须相信<em>你</em>能做到。虽然完成一件事并不一定会转化为全面的动力，但取得更大的成功可能会鼓励提高自我效能。</li><li><strong>阅读大量具有鼓舞人心但可信信息的书籍。</strong>如果适度的自欺欺人在启动这些转变中发挥了作用，那么你从阅读励志材料中获得的暂时提升可能会增加你达到拐点的机会。但如果你不相信，灵感就会失败。因此，找到对你来说似乎可信的乐观来源比仅仅选择最俗气的自助标题更重要。</li><li><strong>寻找具有挑战性的、有价值的目标。</strong>至少就我自己而言，我觉得创业的愿望是一种催化剂。一个有吸引力的目标和知道除非我真的努力工作否则我不会成功的结合似乎至关重要。</li><li><strong>更多的随机性。</strong>最后一个催化剂是让你走出舒适区的经历。这里的想法是，你的日常经历中更大的可变性会增加你偶然发现一个改变你人生轨迹的积极反馈循环的可能性。</li></ul><p>最后，我不完全确定为什么有些人会沉迷于个人生产力、正念冥想、每天锻炼、创业或成为一名全优学生。我不知道为什么他们的生活方向似乎在经历了一次特定的经历后突然发生了变化。但我同意给我发电子邮件的读者的看法，即使这种转变很少见，但它们似乎很重要，而且人们知之甚少。</p><p>

Create your own Socratic tutor.</h3><p> By far, the most common use readers reported was using an LLM as a personal tutor.</p><p> Asking ChatGPT to explain tricky concepts, unfamiliar code or problems seems like an area where LLMs might do alright. And the only reasonable substitute (a human expert) is notoriously expensive and in short supply.</p><p> If you do this in conjunction with a class or textbook, the risks of mistakes also seem attenuated since you still have a primary source to compare against. Challenge explanations that don&#39;t jive with what you&#39;ve read in the book rather than taking everything the AI says at face value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Practice chatting in new languages.</h3><p> The next most common way people used LLMs to learn better was as a language tutor. This seems like a task LLMs are well-equipped for. Whatever their other flaws, they can produce grammatically correct text.</p><p> Many people set up their conversations with ChatGPT so that the AI could go back and forth between the language they are learning and English explanations when they got confused. Likely, those explanations may be imperfect, but human tutors also often give incorrect accounts of the grammar and vocabulary they manage to use proficiently.</p><p> Another use is rewriting texts to be at a more beginner-friendly level of reading comprehension. Graded readers and comprehensive input are great strategies for learning to read in another language. Unfortunately, learner materials are often sparse or uninteresting. You can use an LLM to transform a text you want to read that is written at a fluent native level into something appropriate for your current ability.</p><p> Duolingo seems to be getting in on the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">LLM game as well</a> . I&#39;ve been harsh on the drag-and-drop style of language learning used in earlier versions, but these new advances may force me to revise my opinion.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Generate summaries of longer texts.</h3><p> Summaries are another area where LLMs seem to excel. Consumer applications already exist for <a href="https://consensus.app/">generating summaries</a> of journal articles or research topics.</p><p> Several readers said they were using these AI tools to provide digests of their substantial reading material, helping them keep atop new developments in their field.</p><p> Good summaries, especially those fine-tuned to your particular needs, might be a good way of navigating the large information loads we often face in knowledge work. You could use it to help prioritize which documents to read in-depth or do a first pass organizing unfamiliar material. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15095" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-768x366.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1536x732.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary.jpg 1619w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> It looks like ChatGPT is not able to open links to summarize directly, but it often does a reasonable job hallucinating with famous texts like the one I used above. Until this functionality is standard in the consumer application, it&#39;s better to copy+paste.</p></blockquote><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Dialog with long documents.</h3><p> LLMs also can help you “ask questions” of longer texts. For instance, when reading a scientific paper you could quickly query the sample size or ask for the methodology or results. <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a> does this while offering references, so the risk of mistakes seems reduced when you can easily double-check the LLM&#39;s work.</p><p> While there are more fanciful usages here, such as people asking ChatGPT to impersonate a given writer and dialog with them, I suspect the ability to ask natural-language questions of documents and receive replies with references is a useful tool for dealing with large texts.</p><p> That said, you must be prepared to fact-check the LLM&#39;s answers. For instance, in the dialog captured below, I asked ChatGPT to list evidence supporting strongly-guided instruction, and it cited a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.59.1.14">review article by Mayer</a> . But it falsely claimed Mayer&#39;s work was a meta-analysis, which it isn&#39;t. In fact, the paper isn&#39;t even a comprehensive literature review but simply looks at three prominent cases of the failure of discovery learning. If taken at face value, this response can potentially mislead, but it&#39;s relatively easy to “check” the AI&#39;s work if you know what text it is transforming. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="745" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15096" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1536x1118.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog.jpg 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. Rewrite texts at different levels of explanatory depth.</h3><p> A major difficulty in following expert thinking is that most expert-level text is written for other experts. Concepts are unexplained, context is lacking and jargon abounds. This means that most people must rely on translators, such as general-market nonfiction or science writers, who present what experts think in a more readable format.</p><p> There seem to be two approaches to using AI tools here. One is simply asking an LLM to explain a popular concept in simpler terms, such as: “Explain quantum computing like I&#39;m an eighth-grader.” The other is to provide ChatGPT with a text or explanation and ask the AI to rewrite it in a more digestible manner.</p><p> I tend to think the latter is a little more reliable since you have the source material to compare with rather than taking ChatGPT&#39;s word for it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. Clear up unfamiliar jargon.</h3><p> Several years ago, I remember reading Tyler Cowen&#39;s <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution blog</a> and being perplexed by his frequent, unexplained use of the term “Straussian” to describe ideas or other thinkers. I Googled for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.</p><p> After a lot of research, I understood the term as meaning, roughly, “closely reading between the lines in prominent thinkers&#39; ideas, looking for what they really meant but couldn&#39;t always express because of prevailing censorship and intellectual orthodoxy.”</p><p> Had ChatGPT existed during my confusion, I could have just gotten this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="422" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15097" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x124.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x316.png 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1536x632.png 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> Many readers found similar benefits in using LLMs to figure out jargon and terms used within a particular community in a way that dictionary definitions often fail to elucidate.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Create study plans and agendas.</h3><p> This usage surprised me, but it showed up enough times among reader replies that I include it here. People seem to like using AI to tell them how and when to learn.</p><p> For instance, some readers asked ChatGPT to break down a complex learning goal and give them a curriculum. Others preferred to go even further, asking for ChatGPT to create a studying schedule for them, given their constraints for the day.</p><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t trust LLMs to give me a well-designed curriculum for a subject. But if I was learning something completely new, it might be a decent starting point. Sometimes the hardest part of approaching a new field is breaking down what appears to be an insurmountable goal. Similarly, sometimes being told when to study can help overcome the inertia of getting started.</p><p> While skill breakdowns might be alright, ChatGPT still struggles with creating reading lists, confabulating books and references. Thus, while it might do well for decomposing an ambiguous learning task, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to give me good resources (yet).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. Provide refreshers on forgotten or infrequently used tools.</h3><p> Programmers were the biggest professional group to reply to my query. I can&#39;t say whether this is because programming is uniquely well-suited to LLMs or because programmers, as a group, are more likely to adopt novel software tools.</p><p> The productivity advantages for programmers seem obvious. I don&#39;t write much code these days, so I haven&#39;t made much use of this well-publicized feature of LLMs. But since a lot of coding is relatively routine, the ability to have a machine create the first draft for an algorithm clearly saves a lot of time.</p><p> While there are cases of people with zero programming knowledge relying on AI output to build applications, I suspect these might be tricky to debug and maintain. In contrast, an expert programmer can override ChatGPT&#39;s output for a language he or she knows particularly well.</p><p> The place LLMs seem to work really well is at the fringes of a programmer&#39;s expertise. Many programmers told me that they found AI helpful in getting starting hints in unfamiliar languages or tools. Their base of programming experience allowed them to make sense of and implement the output, but their unfamiliarity with the underlying language meant the AI saved them a lot of time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. Generate flashcards based on text. (Tentative)</h3><p> Flashcards are a powerful learning tool. They&#39;re also a pain in the butt to make.</p><p> Some readers said they were using ChatGPT to generate flashcards for subjects they&#39;re studying. This seems well within the LLM abilities as a “calculator for words.” Thus, with the correct prompts, you could get fairly good results here—provided you&#39;re inputting the material you wish to see transformed into flashcards and not expecting the LLM to get the facts on its own (see below).</p><p> However, given the difficulty of making “good” flashcards, I wouldn&#39;t enter any into my Anki without reviewing them first. Nonetheless, making flashcards is tedious, so getting a first draft that I later review might speed up the process considerably. The risks seem relatively limited if you confirm the cards&#39; correctness before putting them in your deck.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. Use it to organize your notes. (Advanced)</h3><p> As someone who does a lot of research, I often waste a lot of time trying to locate my notes. Robert Martin finds the same problem. Searching via keywords is fraught because sometimes you can&#39;t remember the exact term you used, even if the meaning is roughly the same.</p><p> Martin <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2023/02/05/gpt-for-second-brain/">solves this problem</a> by using the embedding feature of LLMs. While not strictly ChatGPT, this tool from the same family of natural language processing techniques allows you to find semantically-related notes rather than exact keyword matches.</p><p> Personalized LLMs that live on your hard drive and access your existing data may be a valuable application. I&#39;d love to be able to search things I know I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t quite recall where.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Things NOT To Do</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Don&#39;t expect AI to get facts right.</h3><p> LLMs frequently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">make stuff up</a> . These hallucinations are problematic if you depend on ChatGPT to give correct answers. The prevalence of these mistakes is difficult to say right now. When Wikipedia was released, for instance, “experts” were in an uproar about how the user-generated nature of the website meant it couldn&#39;t ever be relied upon as a source. Except Wikipedia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438900a">actually does fairly well</a> , and some of these knee-jerk reactions were misplaced.</p><p> LLMs haven&#39;t reached Wikipedia&#39;s quality in terms of facts, and we still don&#39;t know much about when they&#39;re likely to get an answer right and when they&#39;re likely to make stuff up. For now, it seems best to use them for situations where the cost of an incorrect answer is minimal, either because you can look it up in a verified source, or because your use of the AI for isn&#39;t factual in nature.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Don&#39;t expect AI to get citations right.</h3><p> While LLMs sometimes mess up facts, they seem abysmal at getting citations right. They frequently invent authors, papers, studies and research.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t use a LLM for any research that I needed to cite, and I would always double-check the sources it does provide.</p><p> Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t ask an LLM to give me a reading list or references to specific books or authors (unless, possibly, the authors were quite famous and likely to be well-represented in the data set).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Don&#39;t expect AI to get the math right.</h3><p> I believe it&#39;s a mistake to attribute general intelligence to LLMs based on their ability to do many tasks at a human level or beyond. As with chess bots and image classifiers, the technology behind LLMs is extremely narrow compared to what we would expect of a human who scored similarly on verbal tests.</p><p> One finding from psychology is that much of reasoning is performed by different subsystems in the brain than those devoted to language. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">This paper</a> argues that LLMs seem to match the neurological evidence from double-dissociation studies: you can have fluent verbal abilities with seriously impaired reasoning and vice versa.</p><p> As such, LLMs are really bad at math. And not just higher-level math that humans struggle with. LLMs often fail at <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt">basic counting tasks</a> . Thus I suspect LLMs would be uniquely bad at a task like providing practice problems for a math class and grading the answers. ChatGPT might be able to explain a math concept well, but be unreliable at actually using it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Have you used ChatGPT or other AI tools to further your learning?

However, before I share that post, I&#39;d like to address a different question.</p><p> One question a few readers have is whether ChatGPT will eliminate the need to learn things. After all, if you can easily ask the machine a question and it will spit out an expert-like answer, what&#39;s the point of getting students to write essays, memorize facts or try to remember a lot of knowledge?</p><p> Like everyone, I&#39;m gobsmacked by the performance of large language models like ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. That said, it&#39;s hard to predict things, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">especially about the future</a> . And I suspect the evolution of new AI tools is harder to predict than most things. We have poor intuitions about what sorts of problems machines can solve, and so the general discourse around AI as a field tends to swing between wild pessimism and optimism as we learn more about the path ahead.</p><p> One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won&#39;t make learning obsolete.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Learning Still Matters</h2><p> One reason I can feel confident about the continued value of learning is that while ChatGPT is novel, the kind of technological change it has brought about is not.</p><p> Humans have been inventing technology that has replaced aspects of cognitive work for thousands of years. In every case, the result of that substitution was not a diminishing of the need for skills and knowledge—but an increase.</p><p> Consider the impact of writing. Human knowledge used to be transmitted orally. When writing became available, thinkers such as Socrates decried the damage it would do to people&#39;s memory. We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down.</p><p> Or consider calculators, which have been widespread for decades. You probably have one on your smartphone. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p><p> A robust finding in educational psychology is the importance of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Why-Knowledge-Matters-Rescuing-Educational/dp/1612509525/ref=asc_df_1612509525/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=296035595995&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17947244405290068344&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001551&amp;hvtargid=pla-464465047333&amp;psc=1">background knowledge</a> . People who know more about a subject can understand and retain more of what they read. Knowledge outside your head doesn&#39;t count, since it can&#39;t participate in learning and reasoning.</p><p> Similarly, even if you use a calculator all the time, you understand math better when you first learn to do it by hand. Working through low-level calculations creates conceptual and procedural skills that build an intuitive sense for the underlying algorithms. While you can save effort by using a calculator, the intuition you gained from your initial learning helps you recognize if the calculation is correct and how to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p> The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Will ChatGPT Change What Knowledge Matters?</h2><p> So perhaps we can safely reject the extreme position that learning will become obsolete. Won&#39;t LLMs change what <em>kind</em> of knowledge is worth learning?</p><p> This is probably the case. But it&#39;s not obvious to me what the transition will be, and I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s intuitions on this are correct either.</p><p> The gut reaction seems to be that since large language models can easily spit out an explanation to any question answerable within the sphere of well-documented human knowledge, LLMs devalue this kind of book learning.</p><p> Even putting aside the hallucinations and failings of current LLMs and assuming engineers perfect the technology to the point where it rarely gets these questions wrong, I&#39;m not sure this intuition is correct.</p><p> As mentioned in the research on background knowledge, your ability to ask a useful question and then understand an LLM&#39;s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess. For instance, economist and polymath Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/what-is-the-single-best-way-of-improving-your-gpt-prompts.html">argues</a> that asking an economics question to ChatGPT goes better if you ask it to answer in the style of Milton Friedman or Paul Krugman. Your own economics knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a new phenomenon. If the answers to all the world&#39;s questions were already on the Internet, but you didn&#39;t know where to look, they&#39;d be invisible to you.</p><p> Contrary to the supposition that book learning will be less relevant, I suspect that it will be <em>more</em> important. The people who get the most programming help from ChatGPT are existing programmers—since their knowledge allows them to ask well-formulated programming questions and accurately assess the results. LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Subjects/Skills are Still Worth Learning?</h2><p> A few people wrote to me wondering whether it even makes sense to learn second languages, programming, creative writing or art, given the ever-increasing powers of these applications.</p><p> My feeling is that, on the whole, the value of these skills hasn&#39;t changed much. What will probably change is the differential value of mastery versus novice levels of various skills. There may be fewer professional opportunities available for mediocre programmers, writers, artists or translators. This kind of skill polarization has been going on for a long time, as I documented in my book <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . ChatGPT is just a continuation of current trends.</p><p> But just as there&#39;s a diminished value for someone who can crank out stock art or kludge together a website, there&#39;s probably increased value for those sophisticated enough to use these tools in collaboration with their professional expertise.</p><p> What if we get genuinely general artificial intelligence? An application so advanced it can perform any cognitive task better than a person, or indeed, better than a person in collaboration with a machine? Chess seems to provide an illustrative example, with top chess engines picking better moves than top players—even those who have access to top chess engines.</p><p> In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we&#39;ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we&#39;ll all get <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">turned into paperclips</a> . Who knows?</p><p> But, despite the uncertain long-term forecast, I&#39;m fairly confident that the short-to-medium-term impact of tools like ChatGPT will not be to devalue learning complex skills and knowledge, but will actually increase the value of these activities. As with other technological advances that have come before, it will be the quick and enthusiastic learners who reap the benefits.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/">No, ChatGPT Doesn&#39;t Mean You Don&#39;t Need to Learn Things</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15058 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A summary of my views on how transfer of learning works, based on research.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Transfer occurs when learning one thing helps you learn or do something else. It&#39;s arguably the most important issue in educational psychology. After all, we spend years in the classroom. One would hope the things we learn make us more productive on the job, conscientious as citizens or intelligent in our daily lives.</p><p> Yet it turns out the titular question is really difficult to answer. This is because the answer depends on three different questions, each of which is itself incredibly complicated:</p><ol><li> How do we perform skills?</li><li> How do we acquire them?</li><li> What sorts of skills are used in real life?</li></ol><p> About two years ago, I started a research project to learn everything I could about transfer. It quickly became clear that understanding transfer depended on answering the other three questions, so my research broadened drastically.</p><p> Despite two years of research and a lot of writing about transfer (including a chapter of <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> ), I still don&#39;t have a definitive answer for how much transfer we can expect. But I&#39;d like to share at least how I&#39;ve come to think about the issue.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question One: How Do We Perform Skills?</h2><p> Essentially, transfer is a product of overlap. We should expect transfer from one skill to another when something in those two skills is essentially the same. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15068" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Nearly every well-articulated theory of transfer is an overlap theory. What differs between theories is the “something” which potentially overlaps. Let&#39;s consider some candidates:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad mental faculties.</strong> In <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/formal-discipline">this framework</a> , “reasoning” or “memory” overlap across different skills. This theory likens the mind to a muscle that can be strengthened through many types of practice. This would suggest transfer is quite broad and that almost any strenuous mental activity should produce benefits.</li><li> <strong>Stimulus-response.</strong> Perhaps, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorists</a> , the mind is merely a collection of habits, stimulus leading inevitably to response? This view would suggest transfer is extraordinarily limited—every superficial change in a situation would require a new skill.</li><li> <strong>Propositions and productions.</strong> Theories like <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/02/15/act-r/">ACT-R</a> argue that our brains store skills in essentially two forms: small chunks of factual knowledge and simple component procedures. Complex skills and knowledge are simply aggregates of these foundational pieces.</li><li> <strong>Schemas.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">Schema-based theories</a> claim that knowledge is organized in patterns larger than individual actions or chunks. These patterns roughly correspond to “templates” with both fixed and variable components. For instance, we might have a “birthday party” schema that includes birthday cake and presents, but only optionally clowns or pointy paper hats.</li><li> <strong>Neural networks.</strong> The brain is made out of neurons, and we have some idea of how those neurons process information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">Connectionist</a> theories take these basic neuronal properties as a starting point and posit theories of learning based on them. Teasing out implications for transfer is harder here, but it would most likely look like an overlap in the synaptic connectivity between two skills.</li><li> <strong>Activity systems.</strong> Perhaps transfer isn&#39;t in our heads but is a property of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">broader social and physical environments</a> ? In this view, the person relies on their environment to perform a skill, and transfer fails when those environmental supports are altered.</li></ul><p> Only the first two seem to be demonstrably false. The <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/09/13/brain-training-doesnt-work/">mind is not like a muscle</a> , nor is it a simplistic stimulus-response device.</p><p> I find the information-processing perspective of cognitive science to be the most persuasive. The mind is essentially computational (although quite different from computers made out of transistors). Answering the question of transfer depends on how the algorithms for skills are composed.</p><p> From this perspective, what seems safe to say is that skills can only reliably influence each other if they overlap in either their procedures or knowledge. If two skills don&#39;t use the same process, and the knowledge they depend on is different, there shouldn&#39;t be much (if any) transfer.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15058' title="I’m leaving aside analogies. Analogies suggest two domains that have nothing to do with each other may actually be a source of transfer. But another way of saying this is that analogies suggest an abstract commonality between two superficially different domains. When analogies are useful, they tend to share an overlapping deep structure, so I would include them as an &amp;#8220;overlap&amp;#8221; theory, even if the overlap is an active process rather than the nature of the mental representations themselves."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Two: How Do We Acquire Skills?</h2><p> How the mind represents skills is only one part of understanding transfer. There&#39;s also the issue of how we acquire these representations. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15069" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Here, a few things seem pertinent:</p><ul><li> <strong>Expert-novice differences.</strong> Experts appear to represent ideas at a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220480253_Categorization_and_Representation_of_Physics_Problems_by_Experts_and_Novices">deeper level than novices</a> . The most likely explanation is that skills become more abstract as we encounter more examples and learn to generalize and distinguish concepts.</li><li> <strong>Automaticity effects</strong> . Skills tend to recede from conscious awareness with experience. There are many different proposed mechanisms for this in psychology, but a consequence seems to be that how the expert <em>thinks</em> they perform a skill may not fully capture what they&#39;re actually doing.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15058' title="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Read-Thinking-Learning-about/dp/0262510766/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678392728&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;science on reading&lt;/a>; seems relevant here: careful experimentation seems to indicate that fluent readers decode words letter-by-letter, even though we may feel like we recognize meaning holistically as we look at text."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li> <strong>Mnemonic effects.</strong> Another complication is that even if there is no overlap between two skills in expert performance, there might be an overlap at an earlier stage of acquisition. Vimla Patel has explored this in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10401338909539394?journalCode=htlm20">medical cognition</a> . She comments on the finding that basic science tends to be used infrequently in clinical practice. However, that doesn&#39;t mean learning basic science is useless for doctors because it forms a scaffolding for making sense of clinical knowledge, thus aiding in its acquisition.</li><li> <strong>Declarative-to-procedural transitions.</strong> Another characteristic progression in learning is for skills to start as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a> —things we know and think about explicitly—and shift to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">procedural knowledge</a> —actions we take automatically. This transformation implies that skills may have different patterns of transfer at different levels of mastery as their dominant mental representation changes.</li><li> <strong>Cognitive load.</strong> Different training activities work better for <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">different stages of skill acquisition and working memory capacity</a> . Studying an example, for instance, is better than solving a problem when cognitive load is high, but the opposite is true when cognitive load is low. Efficiency of practice, then, is more than just a question of overlap but also of the stage of learning. Early on, drills, practice on component skills and structured lessons are more helpful. Later on, complex, realistic practice matters more.</li></ul><p> On top of these psychological details, there&#39;s the issue of pedagogy. There are often multiple methods for teaching something. Those methods have varying levels of generality and can apply to a broader or narrower range of concepts. Transfer, then, also depends on how something is taught.</p><p> My sense from reading this research is that there are a few pitfalls to avoid:</p><ul><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer potential by the abilities of novices.</strong> Novices have a more superficial, context-bound understanding. That&#39;s more indicative of their phase of skill acquisition than the ultimate potential for transfer.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer on one-shot problem-solving tests.</strong> Problems often require many pieces of knowledge and procedures to solve correctly. Failure in the tested task could mean a complete failure of transfer, or it could mean that a person is 99% of the way there but still missing one piece. A better test is to train a person on task A, then on task B, and measure the time savings on B from the knowledge and skills acquired in A.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t trust experts&#39; perceptions of how they do a task.</strong> Experts are<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Ourselves-Discovering-Adaptive-Unconscious/dp/0674013824">bad at introspecting</a> their cognitive procedures. We tend to underrate knowledge we&#39;ve already acquired, seeing it as obvious. The ease of automaticity fools us into thinking the complex skills we perform are simple. This can lead to an inappropriate devaluing of “basic” skills.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Three: How are Skills Used in Real Life?</h2><p> The final question is about the kinds of cognitive activities people engage in during work, school and daily life. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15070" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> While possibly the most relevant question of the three, it is also the hardest to answer. Few studies have looked systematically at the kinds of cognitive skills people regularly employ at work and at home.</p><p> Critics allege that much of what we learn in school has little real-world application.</p><p> John Anderson <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Memory-Integrated-John-Anderson/dp/0471249254">reports</a> that employers either want very basic skills (which the educational system should already be teaching) or highly specific skills that no universal curriculum could aspire to. Similarly, Peter Cappelli <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Good-People-Cant-Jobs/dp/B00FJUFFD8/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Smadj&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_p=22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_r=138-5005353-2745032&amp;pd_rd_wg=vgzAZ&amp;pd_rd_r=36883576-42ee-403e-89ee-0ccca61e0046&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk">argues</a> that surveys show employers tend not to highly value academic skills.</p><p> Jean Lave <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cognition-Practice-Mathematics-Culture-Everyday/dp/0521357349/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UHF1GP7YERE1&amp;keywords=jean+lave+cognition+in+practice&amp;qid=1681499209&amp;sprefix=jean+lave+cognition+in+practic%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-2">found</a> that the mathematics taught in school is rarely what people use in their daily routines.</p><p> Bryan Caplan <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652">argues</a> that much of education is signaling—showing others we have smarts, conformity and work-ethic—rather than cultivating those abilities. From this perspective, the real purpose of schools is to sort people, not to teach useful skills. School knowledge doesn&#39;t apply to real life, Caplan argues, because that&#39;s not the function it serves in society.</p><p> Supporters of education argue that just because most skills aren&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re useless. We may become specialists of one sort or another, but unless we assign everyone a career at birth, we want to maintain maximum flexibility until our adult years. A side-effect of this desire to maintain flexibility is that we end up learning a lot that we don&#39;t ever end up using, or that is insufficiently concrete to apply in practice without further training.</p><p> Similarly, education proponents <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mindware-Tools-for-Smart-Thinking/dp/B0719GQ4GZ/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=284313338521&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9001556&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=15299944356742459999&amp;hvtargid=kwd-314760458336&amp;hydadcr=14950_9480932&amp;keywords=mindware+nisbett&amp;qid=1681499263&amp;sr=8-1">point out</a> that just because a skill isn&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be. Statistics is a powerful tool for reasoning about many important issues. The fact that people are statistically naive shows we should be teaching them more, not declaring it impotent!</p><p> Whether we apply a skill in a new context depends on the effort it requires. Practice can lower the effort of applying a skill in real life and create more situations where it is convenient to use. Imagine rewinding time to before widespread literacy; it would be perverse to argue that reading isn&#39;t useful because most people don&#39;t read.</p><p> My perspective is that, while many academic subjects aren&#39;t used, it&#39;s difficult to appreciate a subject until you learn it. Given that we generally cannot “infer” a domain of knowledge simply by encountering problems that apply it, this argument favors accumulating more knowledge than you think you&#39;ll need.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Side Note: Transfer of Effort, Motivation and “Noncognitive” Skills</h2><p> Thus far I&#39;ve been looking at transfer through a cognitive lens. A somewhat separate issue is the transfer of things like the ability to focus and study for long periods of time, the ability to resist temptations, or the motivation to want to learn.</p><p> Many of the same arguments used above apply to noncognitive skills as well. There&#39;s unlikely to be something like a general faculty you can improve with bulk training efforts for motivation, persistence or focus.</p><p> That said, the arguments about transfer here are somewhat different because these are not complex skills (in the information processing sense of “complex”). Sitting at your desk and focusing for eight hours may be difficult, but it&#39;s not <em>computationally</em> demanding.</p><p> Thus while I think it&#39;s ridiculous to imagine improving your memory by memorizing Latin verbs, it&#39;s not ridiculous to imagine improving your ability to focus by regularly sitting down to focus. Believing that cognitive skills are highly specific, and should show limited transfer, is not logically incompatible with a more general transfer of effort or persistence. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15071" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I might write a fuller summary of my views later, but I want to clarify that while “speaking French” and “being able to focus” are both discussed as skills, they have a different locus of difficulty. French is hard because there are lots of words, grammar and mental processes you need to perform it.

Students are often bored and disengaged in lectures. They fail to transfer what they learn to the real world. Real life involves active effort and problem-solving, whereas so much of traditional schooling seems to be regurgitation of memorized facts.</p><p> The authors here argue that those intuitions are misguided. The research favors strongly-guided forms of instruction. Methods in which skills are carefully explained and taught consistently outperform methods that rely on students discovering, inventing or creating their own solutions.</p><p> This paper attracted enough controversy that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Constructivist-Instruction-Success-Sigmund-Tobias/dp/0415994241/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=duffy+tobias+constructivist+education+success+or+failure&amp;qid=1634325516&amp;sr=8-1">an entire book</a> was created with various experts weighing in on both sides.

His studies show how faulty our reasoning typically is, even in areas where we have extensive experience. Other research shows that experts often perform poorly, despite considerable confidence.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15030' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15030' title="Examples of expert overconfidence includes Philip Tetlock’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691175977/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1680383649&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;Expert Political Judgement&lt;/a>;, where political experts did little better than chance, Paul Meehl’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1997-02834-005&quot;>;well-replicated finding&lt;/a>; that clinical judgement typically does worse than simple statistical rules, and the finding that active investors tend to fail to deliver superior returns."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><p> Gary Klein has spent years studying top performers in naturalistic environments.

A Taxonomy for Far Transfer</a> by Susan Barnett and Stephen Ceci</h2><p> Transfer is undoubtedly the most important issue in education. We&#39;re engaging in transfer whenever we learn something in one setting and apply it in another. Thus, the utility of any school, book, course or training experience hinges on transfer.</p><p> Despite this, many more studies report failures of transfer than robust successes, and the causes of this have been endlessly debated.</p><p> Barnett and Ceci review some of the research while adding that what we call “transfer” can really be broken down into several different dimensions, such as:</p><ul><li> Transfer between domains (eg, learning about exponential growth in a biology class and applying it to the stock market)</li><li> Transfer between contexts (eg, learning to multiply in school and then applying that at the grocery store)</li><li> Transfer over time (eg, learning something in 9th grade and applying it during your working life)</li></ul><p> My opinion is that resolving questions about transfer is so difficult because they&#39;re actually questions about how the mind works. Knowing how much transfer is possible hinges directly on how the mind represents skills and knowledge. Until a consensus theory emerges, transfer will continue to attract debate.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191">Self-Efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change</a> by Albert Bandura</h2><p> Classic theories of motivation focused on the relationship between outcome expectations and our willingness to act. Under these theories, we take actions we believe will be rewarded.</p><p> Bandura modified this by suggesting another variable: do we believe we can execute the action needed to get the result? If our self-efficacy is low, we may think that success is valuable but still fail to find the motivation to take action. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15054" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <sup>Reproduced from Social Learning Theory by Albert Bandura</sup></figcaption></figure></div><p> Bandura posited four contributors to self-efficacy, two weak and two strong:</p><ol><li> <strong>Bodily arousal (weak)</strong> .

Bloom&#39;s challenge was to see if any pedagogical techniques could approach the gains seen with tutoring but could apply to a classroom with dozens of students.</p><p> Bloom believed he had found an answer in mastery learning. In this approach, students are given many interim tests. Those who fail to master the material are given new explanations, practice and an opportunity to try again. The idea is that catching difficulties early will prevent them from becoming ongoing problems.</p><p> While most meta-analyses of mastery learning put the effect size closer to <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Visible-Learning/dp/B07SR5D29D/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DM52P3XHBU14&amp;keywords=visible+learning&amp;qid=1680383890&amp;sprefix=visible+learnin%2Caps%2C178&amp;sr=8-3">0.5 standard deviations</a> , a far cry from the two sigma Bloom sought, this is still a relatively strong effect.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0040373">Blind Variation and Selective Retentions in Creative Thought as in Other Knowledge Processes</a> by Donald Campbell</h2><p> Drawing on an analogy to biological evolution, Campbell argues that randomness is an overlooked variable in learning and creative thinking.</p><p> He argues that all knowledge generation proceeds by:</p><ol><li> <strong>A trial-and-error process to induce some knowledge about the world.</strong> As with evolution, we try things out and retain what works.</li><li> <strong>Using previously-acquired knowledge instead of guessing.</strong> Once you uncover valid knowledge using the first process, you can apply it without the need for random guessing.</li><li> <strong>Even applying previously-acquired knowledge, there is variation and randomness generating further possibilities.</strong></li></ol><p> This suggests that much of what we associate with inventive creativity is simply (a) acquiring the relevant set of knowledge associated with the field and then (b) trying out lots of things and keeping what works.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00461528209529247">Antagonism Between Achievement and Enjoyment in ATI Studies</a> by Richard Clark</h2><p> Aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI) are when the same learning technique elicits different effects in students with different prior abilities.</p><p> A common finding in ATI studies is that low-ability students learn much better with highly-structured approaches, whereas higher-ability students benefit from less-structured environments. One explanation seems to be that if you lack the necessary knowledge and skills, guidance ensures you learn the material correctly. Still, if you already have them, then challenging, open-ended environments give you needed practice applying what you know.</p><p> It would seem reasonable to expect students to opt for the method of learning that works best for them. Low-ability students would recognize their difficulties and seek structure; high-ability students would try more challenging assignments.</p><p> Except when Clark reviewed the ATI literature, he found the opposite. Students tend to prefer the method that works less well for them, often unaware that it hinders their achievement. One explanation is that learning is effortful, and we enjoy learning methods that seem to save us effort.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.102.2.211">Long-Term Working Memory</a> by Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch</h2><p> Few concepts are as central to the science of learning as working memory. Our mental bandwidth is limited, and we can only keep in mind a few things at a time.</p><p> Given that we can only hold a few things in memory at once, how do we perform complex tasks?</p><p> One theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> . Through experience, we learn to recognize whole patterns of information as a single unit, allowing us to keep more in our heads at once. Remembering a random seven-digit number is hard, but we easily recall our phone number.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch review evidence that suggests chunking is insufficient to explain expert performance. For example, experts seem strangely impervious to interruptions. When reading a story rife with distractor sentences, comprehension of the story itself remains largely intact. This starkly contrasts with typical memory experiments, where distractors can completely wipe out memory for a task.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch argue that as we gain skill in an activity, we get better at using our long-term memories as a form of working memory, effectively expanding our capacity for familiar tasks.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fcdev.12272">Does Learning to Read Improve Intelligence</a> by Stuart Ritchie, Timothy Bates and Robert Plomin</h2><p> Keith Stanovich was among the first to propose that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">reading ability could bootstrap intelligence</a> . The logic of the hypothesis is compelling:</p><ol><li> Much of the world&#39;s knowledge is available only through reading.</li><li> Reading ability tends to be self-reinforcing, as good readers get more practice than poor ones.</li><li> By reading more, people can learn more things and thus become smarter.</li></ol><p> The study by Ritchie et al. explores this hypothesis further by examining how early reading ability impacts later intelligence. They studied identical twins to control for genetic differences in intelligence. The researchers found that twins with higher reading ability showed greater improvements in intelligence over time compared to their sibling.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0364021394900167">Eliciting Self-Explanations Improves Understanding</a> by Michelene Chi, Nicholas de Leeuw, Mei-Hung Chiu, and Christian LaVancher</h2><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of what I call the Feynman Technique: take a complicated concept or procedure, and explain it as if you were teaching it to someone else.</p><p> Thus, it was interesting to come across formal research on self-explanations! In this experiment, the researchers encouraged students to explain what they were learning. They found that engaging in explanation tended to increase students&#39; understanding of the material.</p><p> My preferred explanation for this effect is attention. When reading an explanation, you generally don&#39;t have much motivation to test whether or not you understand it. In contrast, when generating an explanation, you get clear feedback about what you know and what you don&#39;t. This feedback returns your attention to the source material or problem to work out what is missing, resulting in a richer understanding than if you had stuck to the reading alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/">Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reader Request: How Should I Use ChatGPT to Learn Better?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 03 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15023 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Have you been using ChatGPT in your learning efforts?

But I was enthralled—both by the amount of work that has been done on figuring out how people learn to read (and the best way to teach them) and by what it implies for learning other skills.</p><p> Fluent readers can comprehend text at a rate of several words per second. Given this, it&#39;s easy to believe that we skim over words, infer the text by its likely context or don&#39;t pay attention to the letters. Fascinatingly, studies show that this isn&#39;t the case: good readers fixate on nearly every word in a sentence and seem to pay attention to nearly every letter in each word.</p><p> We manage to do this because the sound-spelling patterns are so thoroughly overlearned that unconscious neural networks, acting simultaneously, perform the cognitive “work” of decoding text.</p><p> In light of this, Adams argues that the best way to learn to read is, first, to learn systematically the basic sound-spelling combinations in language (ie, phonics), and second, to engage in lots and lots of reading where attention is focused on the sequence of letters to identify words.</p><p> I may eventually do a fuller write-up of Adams&#39;s book, as it contains a lot of nuggets for thinking about other skills that haven&#39;t been researched as thoroughly as learning to read.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Learning-Theory-Albert-Bandura/dp/0138167443">Social Learning Theory</a> by Albert Bandura</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Social-Learning-Theory-Albert-Bandura/dp/0138167443"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL-205x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15008" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL-205x300.jpg 205w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/41aBGsYxcyL.jpg 342w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></a></figure></div><p> In this psychology classic, Albert Bandura introduced the idea of self-efficacy to studies of motivation.</p><p> Many early theories of motivation focused on expected benefits. If I thought the likely outcome of action X would be good for me, I&#39;d feel motivated to do X. In contrast, if X involved risk or harm, I&#39;d feel averse to taking that action.</p><p> Yet these theories seem ill-equipped to explain the diversity of motivation we see in practice. Why do some students study hard for a test while others slack? Moreover, why do we fail to motivate ourselves to do things we readily understand are in our self-interest?</p><p> Bandura argued that it wasn&#39;t merely our sense of the presumed benefits of taking an action, but also our beliefs about our ability to take that action, that influenced our motivation. A student who thinks she can&#39;t pass, no matter how hard she studies, won&#39;t be motivated—even if the cost of failure is high.</p><p> We gain self-efficacy for specific actions by seeing them done by others or, better yet, succeeding with them ourselves. Mastery experiences can become a reinforcing cycle, as experiencing success leads to greater self-efficacy and motivation.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 3.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analyses-Achievement/dp/0415476186">Visible Learning</a> by John Hattie</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Visible-Learning-Synthesis-Meta-Analyses-Achievement/dp/0415476186"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-212x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15010" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-212x300.jpg 212w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-724x1024.jpg 724w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-1086x1536.jpg 1086w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL-1448x2048.jpg 1448w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/81L9Z78MjUL.jpg 1810w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></figure></div><p> What works in education? Unfortunately, the answer is seemingly everything. Every pet theory and learning technique has some supporter, armed with a study showing how well it works. But when everything works, what should you focus on?</p><p> One way around this quagmire is through meta-analyses. This technique groups together many studies to find the average effect of an intervention. Hattie&#39;s book goes even further, compiling 800 different meta-analyses in education to see a bird&#39;s-eye view of what works well for learning.</p><p> Hattie concludes that feedback plays a central role: not just the feedback of correcting students&#39; mistakes, but feedback to the teacher on what students are learning and failing to grasp. Mastery learning, direct instruction and reciprocal teaching fare well in Hattie&#39;s analysis.</p><p> This was my second time through Hattie&#39;s book, and I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be my last.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Creativity-Robert-J-Sternberg/dp/0521576040">The Handbook of Creativity</a> edited by Robert Sternberg</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Creativity-Robert-J-Sternberg/dp/0521576040"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15011" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/51CTYllSlQL.jpg 907w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></figure></div><p> Creativity is one of our most mythologized abilities. It&#39;s also one of the most poorly understood.</p><p> I found this book useful for comparing different perspectives on creativity, including the role of expertise, chance, social environment and personality traits in what results in creative thinking.</p><p> The gist I get from reading these different perspectives is that creativity is a combination of:</p><ol><li> <strong>Individual problem-solving ability.</strong> Like routine problem-solving, this is a process of applying previous knowledge to generate new options.</li><li> <strong>Social recognition.</strong> Whether something is “creative” is a judgement based on prevailing opinions rather than an intrinsic trait of the thing itself.</li><li> <strong>Risk-taking and randomness.</strong> A “creative” vs. “routine” expert might be distinguished by the former&#39;s willingness to bet big on risks.</li></ol><p> Creativity is not a “skill” in this view. It&#39;s not something you can practice or learn how to do. Instead, it&#39;s a by-product of acquired expertise and a willingness to take intellectual risks.</p><p> Thus, the best way to be more creative is to learn a lot and take a lot of swings.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Mastery-Learning-Thomas-Guskey/dp/1071851004">Implementing Mastery Learning</a> by Thomas Guskey</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Mastery-Learning-Thomas-Guskey/dp/1071851004"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-791x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15012" width="200" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-232x300.jpg 232w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-768x994.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L-1582x2048.jpg 1582w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/71Joe6u-73L.jpg 1978w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /></a></figure></div><p> Mastery learning is one of the more effective pedagogical techniques for achievement, with powerful effects among weaker students.</p><p> The basic idea is simple: students are given lots of interim tests that don&#39;t count for grades.

Learning in this stage involves trying to apply instructions or explanations in practice.</li><li> <strong>Associative.</strong> Here, you&#39;re practicing on your own and trying to eliminate major errors.</li><li> <strong>Automatic.</strong> Finally, skills recede from conscious awareness as the mechanism for executing them relies less and less on our working memory systems.</li></ol><p> Automaticity has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> The advantage is that it frees up resources to do other things. For skills like reading or driving, this can be essential. If you can&#39;t automatically recognize words or manipulate the steering wheel, additional tasks, like analyzing a text or finding your way in a new city, are nearly impossible.</p><p> The disadvantage is that, being automated, skills overlearned to this point are very difficult to change or correct. Anders Ericsson proposed that much of becoming a world-class expert was engaging in practice efforts that work to undo some of the effects of this skill automation, using drills that bring awareness of the skill back under effortful control.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/">Recent Reading: Creativity, Mastery and the Three Phases of Learning</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are We Losing the Ability to Read Books?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 21 Mar 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=14994 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A Gallup poll shows we&#39;re reading fewer books each year.

US adults are reading roughly two or three fewer books per year than they did between 2001 and 2016.</p><p> ……</p><p> The decline is greater among subgroups that tended to be more avid readers, particularly college graduates but also women and older Americans. College graduates read an average of about six fewer books in 2021 than they did between 2002 and 2016, 14.6 versus 21.1.</p></blockquote><p> This is a worrying trend.</p><p> It&#39;s possible, of course, to read fewer books and still engage in deep thinking. You can watch university classes on YouTube and read scientific papers online. Wikipedia does more than paper encyclopedias could have ever accomplished.</p><p> Yet books still represent the best format for deep, sustained engagement with an idea or story. A decline in reading books does not necessarily mean a loss of depth in every case, but it probably indicates a trend toward more shallow engagement on average.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Has Reading Books Declined?</h2><p> The poll did not analyze the cause of the decline. However, a likely explanation is that this decline closely tracks the rise of social media and smartphones. Reading books is a leisure activity that struggles to compete with the algorithmic engineering underlying most online content. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/choose.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> Anecdotally, this fits with many conversations I have had. Many people who used to pick up a book during their spare time now pick up their phone instead.</p><p> Reading books is both a skill and a habit. As an acquired skill, reading is initially effortful but becomes easier as we become fluent, recognizing words and building background knowledge of the matters discussed. As a habit, reading is something we choose to do (or not) in our moments of downtime.</p><p> But both skills and habits can atrophy <strong>.</strong> If you spend less time reading, it takes more effort to work through challenging texts. If you decide to read less often, choosing to read becomes more effortful. Reading books, and the opposite, can both become self-reinforcing actions—readers read more books, while nonreaders find it increasingly hard to do so.</p><p> Given this state of affairs, it&#39;s alarming that book reading is waning. Even if articles like this one act as a partial substitute, the skills and habits needed to engage deeply with ideas may still be declining. <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/01/31/curated-consumption/">Curating our media consumption</a> may be necessary if we want to be the exception.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/">Are We Losing the Ability to Read Books?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/21/reading-fewer-books/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
