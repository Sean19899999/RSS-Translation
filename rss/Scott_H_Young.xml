逐字逐句，仅比阅读它们所需的时间略长。</p><p>鉴于这些令人印象深刻的结果，对于任何严重依赖记忆的技能，从助记符开始似乎是显而易见的。</p><p>相比之下，抽认卡有点无聊。每个人以前都做过。他们是干的和基本的。你在一侧提出问题，在另一侧提出答案，然后你练习（一直练习）直到你可以不假思索地完成它们。没有幻想的意象或秘密方法。只是重复。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">抽认卡被低估了</h2><p>虽然助记法似乎是学习大量新信息的明显选择，但严格比较各种学习策略效果的研究描绘了一幅略有不同的图景。</p><p>在他们对<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/Z10jaVH/60XQM/full">十种流行学习技巧</a>的精彩回顾中，Dunlosky 及其同事总结了关于关键词助记法和练习测试（包括抽认卡）的研究。在这篇评论中，练习测试的实用性获得了最高评分，而关键字助记符获得了较低的评分。</p><p>关键字方法确实有效——也就是说，使用它的学生往往比没有使用它的学生更能记住他们正在记忆的单词。但它有一些限制：</p><ul><li><strong>学习和教授助记方法需要时间。</strong>与抽认卡不同，助记符本身就是一项需要大量练习才能掌握的技能。虽然这可能有利于精英记忆术专家，但对于那些只想学习西班牙语、法律或解剖学的人来说，可能不值得额外投资。</li><li><strong>助记符通常需要花费大量时间，尤其是对于初学者而言。</strong>使用关键字方法创建良好的链接可能需要几分钟，在此期间您可以使用抽认卡重复多次。一项研究平衡了助记法和更多死记硬背之间的任务时间，发现简单地增加重复比使用助记法更有优势。</li><li><strong>助记法在相对较短的间隔内极大地帮助回忆，但它们的好处可能不会持久。</strong>这使得助记法在记忆竞赛中很有用——需要记忆高度随意的信息并能立即回忆起来的事件。相比之下，我们试图记住的大部分内容需要在我们的脑海中停留更长时间。</li></ul><p>相比之下，抽认卡简单快捷。虽然所有的记忆最终都会消失，但抽认卡引起的重复性过度学习是创造长期学习的更持久的方法之一。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">直接检索是学习的最终目标</h2><p>从经验上看，助记符有点混杂。抽认卡似乎有优势，至少在对未受过助记技巧训练的学生进行长期回忆的仔细控制研究中是如此。</p><p>认知理论也支持这一观点。技能习得的一个主要特点是获得结果所使用的方法不是一成不变的。 <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emerging-Minds-Process-Childrens-Thinking-ebook/dp/B000QTD49E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">例如</a>，孩子学习简单的加法时，先数手上的两个数，然后从大数开始数，最后直接找答案。</p><p>随着专业知识的发展，更精细的方法往往会被直接检索答案所取代。这就是专业知识可以相对轻松的原因之一——您只需记住它，而不是通过一个复杂的过程来获得答案。</p><p>从这个角度看，助记术有点像数手指。生动的图像充当了两个概念之间的桥梁，否则很难将它们联系起来。您可以快速学习助记符，它使您能够从一个想法过渡到另一个想法。然而，如果你练习得足够多，这两个想法就会直接联系在一起——没有任何干预意象。</p><p>对于流利度特别重要的情况，例如在说话时回忆词汇，直接检索选项对于大多数单词来说可能是必要的，以免在说太多时陷入困境。这表明，即使你最初是通过助记法学习一个单词，直接检索最终也会取而代之，因为它会成为更快的选择。</p><p>这表明助记术充其量只是一种临时措施。在中短期内，对于那些没有被过度学习以形成直接联想的单词，它们可能会使学习联想变得更容易。

class="wp-block-heading">为什么不兼得？</h2><p>当然，抽认卡和助记词并不相互排斥。第一次遇到抽认卡时可以使用关键字助记符，然后反复学习。这样，助记符提供的临时桥梁可能对学习有益。</p><p>这是我在必须记住大量材料时使用的方法。我从关键字助记符开始，当它相对容易做到时，然后进行大量间隔检索练习以使关联自动且稳健。</p><p>但是，出于以下几个原因，我认为值得研究这两种技术的相对功效：</p><ul><li><strong>许多人对助记法过于兴奋并使用它们代替抽认卡。</strong>出于我在上面阐明的原因，我认为这通常是不明智的。</li><li><strong>有时材料不利于助记。</strong>我发现关键字助记法对于学习欧洲语言的词汇非常有用——但对亚洲语言的帮助就小得多了。 “听起来像”的方法不容易区分中文单词（它们听起来比英语单词听起来更像），所以桥的第一条腿很弱。然而，抽认卡继续发挥作用，是我学习中文和韩语词汇的主要工具。</li><li><strong>对于那些没有接受过记忆术培训的人来说，值得一问应该投入多少时间来获得所需的技能。</strong>虽然助记法有一些有效的用例，但如果不进行大量练习，它们通常会很慢而且很麻烦，这意味着它们最好保留在可能会用于许多记忆密集型主题的情况下。</li></ul><p>简而言之，如果您精通助记法，请务必使用它们来补充您的抽认卡。如果您不是，或者您的主题使它们难以使用，或者您只是不确定优先考虑哪一个，请坚持使用抽认卡。</p><p><a

/></figure></div><p>虽然我在这里使用经济镜头，但推理仍然适用于你的工作之外。作为一种爱好，我有多喜欢绘画取决于我对它的感觉有多好。因此，在进行相同的权衡后，娱乐活动通常会做出隐含的“学习或忽略”决定。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">我们是否对学习投资不足？</h2><p>总而言之，许多关于学习的决定具有以下特征：</p><ul><li>自己动手最初并不能通过成本效益测试。</li><li>练习的越多，成本就越低。</li><li>因此，学习某事是否“值得”取决于对使用该技能需要多少时间的远见计算。</li></ul><p>不幸的是，我们内在的激励系统的<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/12/14/procrastinate-expert/">关注点非常短视</a>。直接成本或回报对我们决策的影响远大于长期成本或回报。实验表明，人们通常会以与任何理性代理人（即使是极度冲动的代理人）<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-02">不一致的方式</a>为延迟奖励支付高额折扣率。</p><p>这表明我们可能在学习上投资不足。我们不愿意练习未能通过初始成本效益分析的技能——即使我们的练习投资在我们的一生中会获利。</p><p>这种洞察力在学习其他语言时帮助了 Vat 和我。当您不经常使用一门语言时，练习该语言的成本相对较高。在短期内，强迫自己使用一种新语言进行交互也是代价高昂的。但是，如果您练习得足够多，说您所访问国家/地区的语言会比完全停留在英语圈内更容易。成年人足智多谋，经常想方设法避免使用不熟悉的语言；结果是，很少有人能接触到幼儿在学习时情不自禁接触到的水平。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">学习中的马太效应</h2><p>这个基本模型的另一个结果是我们应该期待学习中的马太效应。</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect">马太效应</a>最早是由社会学家罗伯特·默顿和哈里特·祖克曼在他们对精英科学家的研究中提出的。杰出的科学家通常比不知名的研究人员在类似的工作中获得更多的荣誉，这意味着，随着时间的推移，知名度往往会增加，而不太知名的学者则默默无闻。<span id='easy-footnote-1-15172'

title="效果的名字来源于马太福音中人才的比喻，“因为凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；没有的，连他所有的，也要夺去。&amp;#8221;"><sup>1个</sup></a></span></p><p>后来，心理学家 Keith Stanovich 将<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">同样的见解应用于阅读</a>。那些在早期阅读能力上略有优势的人阅读新材料的成本略有降低。这导致他们练习更多，进一步降低了阅读成本。考虑到阅读与其他学习形式之间的联系，他甚至假设早期阅读能力可以通过更容易获得新技能和知识来提升智力。</p><p>研究证实了斯坦诺维奇的假设。在<a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12272">一项针对早期阅读能力不同的同卵双胞胎的研究</a>中，与基因相同的兄弟姐妹相比，阅读能力稍强的双胞胎后来表现出更高的智力。技能产生技能；知识产生知识。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">专业化和专注于优势</h2><p>在这一点上，澄清一下很有帮助。我并不是说既然习得的技能通过实践变得更容易，我们就应该为自己做所有事情而不是委托他人。</p><p>这是错误的，即使按照我上面阐明的基本逻辑也是如此。有些任务的遇到频率不足以达到成本/收益阈值。我可能永远没有机会说蒙古语，所以如果我遇到只会说蒙古语的人，我会很乐意依靠谷歌翻译。</p><p>此外，我们不能孤立地考虑技能。花时间学习一件事是不学习其他东西的隐含决定。我可以学习法语，但那段时间被学习普通话占用了。我可以学习 Javascript，但那时间不能也花在学习 Python 上。</p><p>最终，专业化而非自给自足才是我们今天生活的世界的富足之路。我们将生活中的绝大部分技能委派给别人，并不是因为不可能全部学会，而是因为当委派其他事情相对容易时，真正擅长一件事才有意义。</p><p>尽管花了数年时间学习编程，但我几乎没有为自己的生意做任何事情。考虑到我的写作是我业务的核心，而且我没有足够的时间来完成所有我想写的东西，雇用其他人来编写程序<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage">更有意义</a>。反过来，那些人往往比我在专业知识曲线上走得更远，因为他们做出了类似的专业化决定。</p><p>话虽这么说，但在许多情况下，技能不能轻易委派。我也许可以为我的网站聘请幕后编程人员，但聘请某人阅读用于撰写文章的研究并不能节省精力或成本。如果我不理解这项研究，我就无法将其融入我正在制作的文本中。</p><p>在其他情况下，授权是一种不完美或不方便的替代方式，可以替代您自己做某事。当您移居到另一个国家时，依靠翻译并不等同于您自己会说该语言。如果有人大声向您讲述，能够阅读文本并没有变得多余。因此，能够说您所居住国家/地区的语言并能够阅读是几乎肯定值得掌握的技能。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">考虑长期学习</h2><p>当我面对学习新事物的阻力时，我发现记住一些事情很有用：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. 通过更多练习，我可以期望这项技能在多大程度上变得更容易？</h3><p>估计这一点的一种方法是观察具有不同经验程度的人。他们花了多少努力来做你挣扎的事情？某些技能的学习曲线非常陡峭——你很快就能掌握。对于其他人来说，曲线在很长一段时间内都是平坦的——您可能需要练习多年才能觉得值得付出努力。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 如果我更擅长这项技能，我会在多大程度上使用它？</h3><p>假设你可以达到练习曲线的相对平坦部分，你会使用多少？</p><p>如果你生活在一个说一种你不懂的语言的国家，学习那种语言肯定能通过成本效益测试。学习您可能在工作或教育环境中使用的主要世界语言可能也有帮助。一种不常使用的小众语言……也许不是？在这种情况下，只有当你有强烈的内在学习动机时，它才值得学习。</p><p>如果一项技能对你的职业生涯至关重要，那么它可能很容易就值得付出代价，即使它最初对你来说很难学习。相比之下，与您现有技能不相符的职业技能可能会被闲置，即使您已接近专家——外包成本更低。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. 我会在多大程度上享受这项技能，条件是做得更好？</h3><p>经济回报并不是唯一的动机。如果你擅长某事，你往往会更喜欢它并获得个人满足感。但这对某些技能来说比其他技能更真实。您可能会为能够描绘出逼真的风景而感到特别自豪，但不会因为能够快速报税而感到特别自豪。</p><p>决定什么时候学习有意义并不是微不足道的，但鉴于我们的直觉经常给我们一个误导性的短期图景，更深入地思考它可能会有所帮助。</p><p><a

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>学习计划组织三件事：</p><ol><li>你必须学习什么。</li><li>你将如何学习它。</li><li>当你打算投资的时候。</li></ol><p>虽然听起来很简单，但大多数学生并没有制定详细的学习计划。在那些这样做的人中，他们经常犯错误，使计划非常不切实际——这是未来内疚的良方，而不是未来的学习。</p><p>在这篇文章中，我将概述如何制定学习计划——以及如何坚持下去。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">为什么要制定学习计划？</h2><p>学习是努力的。虽然这种努力可能很愉快，但我们当下想做什么的冲动往往与最大化学习的事情不一致。事实上，研究表明，学生经常<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461528209529247">选择感觉有趣但没有成果的活动</a>。</p><p>一个很好的类比是运动。虽然参加一项运动或慢跑可能很有趣，但我们的大脑旨在避免不必要的体力消耗。这就是为什么你很少看到 10 岁以上的人在街上奔跑，除非他们约会迟到。</p><p>如果您想在不伤害自己的情况下锻炼身体，那么制定一个您可以并且会坚持的锻炼计划会有所帮助，而不是只要您愿意就去健身房并使用您偶然发现的任何设备进行锻炼。</p><p>学习的逻辑是一样的。制定计划可以最大限度地增加在需要创造学习的地方投入精力的机会。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第一步：检查您的材料</h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15162" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1024x512.jpg

https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/HP2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p>我假设您已经选择了一些课程、书籍、教程或其他课程来指导您。 （如果你还没有，第一步就是做你的研究并为你想要学习的技能找到一个好的资源！）</p><p>起点是回顾你的课程并弄清楚：</p><ul><li>您需要观看/阅读/复习哪些课程？</li><li>你需要从事哪些实践活动？</li><li>您需要完成哪些必需的可交付成果（论文/作业）？</li><li>您需要如何使用您获得的技能和知识？考虑期末考试的形式以及您计划将所学技能和知识应用到什么地方。</li></ul><p>纯练习项目可能是个例外。在此类项目中，您不是在处理材料，而是在尝试练习或实施您在其他地方获得的知识。对于练习项目，您正在创建自己的课程，因此您可以选择自己的进度。当你已经过了初学阶段时，这些往往会更成功，并且可以更成功地指导你自己的练习。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第二步：计算你的最少时间投资</h2><p>最短时间投入包括完成指定课程所需的所有工作。这包括：</p><ul><li>完成要求的阅读需要多长时间？</li><li>观看任何视频/讲座/课程需要多长时间？</li><li>完成所需的可交付成果（家庭作业、论文、项目）需要多长时间？</li></ul><p>视频和录制的讲座很容易估算：您可以将所有视频的运行时间相加。你能<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/17/faster-listening-works/">以更快的速度观看</a>吗？如果是这样，您可以将总数除以估计的播放速率（例如，1.5 或 2 倍速度）。否则，这个时间是根据课程的时长确定的。</p><p>对于必读，您需要估计您的阅读率。您可以通过计时自己阅读几页并将其推断到整本书来获得初步近似值。缓慢而刻意地阅读；长时间阅读的速度不可避免地比几分钟的冲刺要慢。</p><p>家庭作业很难提前估算，但您可以从课程提供者、老师或过去的学生那里得到估算。</p><p>这里的总体思路是计算在不进行任何额外学习的情况下完成所提供材料的最少时间投入。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第三步：估计额外的学习时间需求</h2><p>对于某些课程，只需完成所有分配的作业，您就可以通过测试并将其应用到现实生活中。但对于大多数课程，你必须超越这一点。</p><p>您可能希望投入时间的其他一些地方是：</p><ul><li>额外的练习题/作业。</li><li>应用于现实生活中的问题和环境。</li><li>创建/审查抽认卡。</li><li>自我解释，例如<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2011/09/01/learn-faster/">费曼技巧</a>。</li><li>教学大纲中未提及的额外研究。</li></ul><p>估计这一点的一个好方法是查看您的个人历史数据：除了最低限度的课程之外，您通常需要投入多少时间才能达到您想要的课堂效果？这里没有“正确”的答案。有些课程是时间密集型的，所需的材料很难通过。其他课程很少，留给学生自己掌握材料。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第四步：在日历中安排学习</h2><p>一旦您有了预期时间投资的详细列表，您就需要弄清楚什么时候您才真正开始做每件事。</p><p>将任何截止日期、考试、现场讲座或课程直接放在您的日历中。对于阅读、做作业、练习等形式的学习，你仍然应该分配时间给它们，但有两种不同的方法：</p><ul><li><strong>最严格的选择是将所有事情安排为约会。</strong>如果学习必须适应已经很拥挤的时间表，我推荐这种方法。因此，如果您是一位忙碌的家长，并且是为执照考试学习的专业人士，您最好将学习时间直接放在您的日历中，否则它会立即被推到一边。</li><li><strong>更灵活的选择是创建每周或每天的例程。</strong>每个区块中的确切活动会根据您的目标而有所不同，但时间承诺本身将是相对常规的。例如，您可能决定每天早上上班前、晚上或周末学习。</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第五步：完整性检查</h2><p>在这个过程的这一点上，我们可以做一个基本的健全性检查：你从第二步和第三步计算的时间投入与你计划的时间相比如何？如果您的项目可用时间少于估计的最小时间，那么您已经有一个非启动器。您需要在您的日程安排中腾出更多时间，重新考虑学习项目的目标，或者延长您允许完成它的时间表。</p><p>如果您的可用时间略多于您的预算，那么您几乎没有犯错的余地。生病、一个意想不到的具有挑战性的话题或意外的中断都可能使整个项目脱轨。</p><p>如果您的可用时间比预算多得多，那不一定是放松的迹象。太松懈了，你可能会在需要学习的时候感觉不到压力，最终会浪费时间拖延。在这些情况下，我建议设置软截止日期，将工作提前到更宽松的时间表。这种方法可以让压力保持舒适但具有挑战性，因此您以后有更多的错误空间。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第六步：获得反馈</h2><p>制定计划是比较容易的部分。困难的部分是坚持下去。幸运的是，如果你在学习时留意你得到的反馈并相应地进行调整，你制定的计划将是一个非常宝贵的指南，而不是在第一次遇到困难时就被扔到一边的东西。</p><p>考虑这些反馈来源：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. 坚持你的日程安排的反馈。</h3><p>反馈的第一个来源是您执行计划的能力。一个有用的策略就是每天将您的意图写在议程或计划表上，然后记录您实际做了什么。例如，你可能打算在星期三学习三个小时，但你被打扰了，只学了两个小时。</p><p>每当与您的计划有偏差时，注意障碍的来源是有帮助的。即使您无法控制一切使您偏离计划的因素，但如果您能识别它们，那么几乎没有什么障碍是无法克服的。考虑：</p><ul><li><strong>由于他人的干扰而产生的偏差。</strong>沟通学习时间的界限，以便其他人理解它的重要性。如果您无法避免打扰，请在您的日程安排中找到后备学习时段，以弥补偶尔的、不可避免的打扰。</li><li><strong>准备不足造成的偏差。</strong>你的电脑坏了。您无法登录您的帐户来访问课程。你不得不买彩色铅笔。想办法在你预定的会议之前做这些事情，或者认为它们是不必要的。</li><li><strong>由于拖延/动机而导致的偏差。</strong>使用<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">番茄工作法</a>，降低您对会话熟练程度的期望以避免完美主义，或者在阅读/练习之间交替进行以避免走神或无聊。</li></ul><p>学习是费力的，真正的障碍可能会出现，因此很难坚持一个人的计划。但是，如果您能确定导致中断的原因，则在许多情况下都可以找到补救措施。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. 学习进度反馈。</h3><p>第二个反馈来源与您的学习进度有关。有时技能和主题会立即融合，您不需要复习它们。在其他情况下，新材料可能看起来令人眼花缭乱，超出了您对掌握所需时间的估计。</p><p>再次重申，关键是观察反馈并将其分解：</p><ul><li><strong>您是否因为基础知识没有牢牢扎根而苦苦挣扎？</strong>练习、抽认卡和对简单问题的反复练习可以帮助解决这个问题。</li><li><strong>您是否因为不理解一个困难的想法而苦苦挣扎？</strong>自我解释、与老师/同龄人/导师交谈以及寻找其他解释来源可能会有所帮助。</li><li><strong>您是否因为看不到自己做错了什么或如何改进而苦苦挣扎？</strong>寻求指导、纠正性反馈或指导可能会有所帮助。</li></ul><p>您识别问题的粒度越细，它们就越容易解决。专注于特定的概念、动作、事实或程序是克服困难的关键。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">第七步：进行修改</h2><p>获得一些反馈后，您可能需要修改计划。如果你落后了，这可能涉及增加你投入的时间，或者你可能会改变你的日常生活，这样你就可以真正投入你说的时间。</p><p>最后，你可能不会完全死板地坚持你的计划。计划的主要好处不是消除所有即兴创作和灵活性。相反，它是为了提前学习和识别障碍所需的时间和精力资源，这样你就可以避免大部分障碍。最终有用的不是计划本身，而是制定计划的想法。</p><p><a

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>一位读者给我发来电子邮件，列举了一些突然改变生活的人的例子：他们开始锻炼，养成更好的习惯，努力学习并取得好成绩，在他们的职业生涯中取得进步……基本上一夜之间就把自己变成了“成功”的人。他想了解为什么会发生这种情况，并询问人们如何尝试进行类似的转变。</p><p>我在其他人身上看到过几次这种性格变化，所以我相信这种现象是真实存在的。我的一些朋友突然变得更有动力、更认真、更有条理和更有野心——通常会为他们自己带来更好的生活成果。</p><p>这也是我亲身经历过的事情。当我大约十五岁时，我改变了饮食习惯，开始早起、定期锻炼、读书并尝试各种提高工作效率的方法。 While the transition took place over a couple of years rather than a singular moment, it still a rather abrupt directional change in my personality that has culminated in who I am today. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-exercise_blog.png" alt="" width="600" height="600"/></figure></div><p> Assuming, for a second, that my introspective self-report and anecdotal observations are accurate, I think the reader&#39;s question is important and merits further discussion. Why do people sometimes abruptly become better versions of themselves? Perhaps more importantly, why does it so often seem to fail?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Discovering Self-Actualization</h2><p> For lack of a better term, I&#39;ll call this kind of transformation discovering self-actualization. That sounds vague, but it&#39;s the best way I can describe the experience. If you&#39;re allergic to self-help jargon, perhaps another way of describing it might be “becoming an adult” or “getting your act together.” </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mirror-you.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p> In my case, I think the changes were triggered by a fundamental restructuring of my belief system. Namely, I began to believe that there is considerable room for autonomy in making decisions over my life and that, if I chose wisely, those decisions could make a big difference in where my life ended up.</p><p> Wanting to start my own business was also a significant trigger. Something about the intrinsic appeal of being my own boss and having complete financial independence, combined with the inherent difficulty in succeeding in that goal, acted as a catalyst. Indeed, I&#39;ve known quite a few people who have discovered self-actualization in the context of professional ambition.</p><p> For other people, the trigger was something more concrete. They read a particular book that changed their worldview ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> , for many). They encountered a new-to-them religion, philosophy or spiritual practice ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a> seems to be another common trigger for change).</p><p> Even if the exact cause is idiosyncratic, I see a few common features:</p><ul><li> <strong>A belief that there are lives better than the one we are currently living.</strong> The central premise is that there&#39;s a broad array of possible futures, and many of them are better than the default. This seems to hold even in philosophical views that reject most kinds of ambition. For instance, those interested in mindfulness meditation often spurn the idea that career ambitions should be made central to life. But they still believe that mindfulness will let them experience a better quality of life.</li><li> <strong>A sudden, pervasive increase in self-efficacy.</strong> While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-efficacy">Bandura&#39;s original concept</a> was decidedly granular, there do appear to be moments where you become more confident in succeeding at a broader range of actions.</li><li> <strong>Increased valuation of delaying gratification and resisting impulses.</strong> The willingness to work hard, do things that make you feel uncomfortable and resist your immediate habits and impulses is also at work. Over a relatively short period, someone who might have struggled with sticking to an exercise program is suddenly taking on dozens of high-effort challenges.</li><li> <strong>(Over)zealous application of the above changes.</strong> Often, people who experience a major paradigm shift are overly optimistic about the value of alternate versions of their life, overly confident about their ability to execute, and overly focused on self-improvement over momentary gratification.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> The Skeptic&#39;s Critique</h2><p> Of course, I&#39;m far from the first to notice this phenomenon. A lot of self-help gurus have built their entire marketing empires around selling people transformative life change. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">Tony Robbins</a> , in particular, seems to make a big deal about these kinds of moments.</p><p> The skeptic would argue that these kinds of changes don&#39;t typically last. Hype fades, and while getting excited about something is easy, we rarely change our personality or behavior permanently.</p><p> I tend to agree with the skeptic—most of the time. I suspect that most people experience one or, maybe, two of these shifts in their entire life. Many people may never experience it. Change, instead, is generally gradual and directionless. Sometimes we get in a bit better shape, sometimes we let ourselves go. Most bursts of self-improvement revert to the mean.</p><p> However, given the significance of these dramatic shifts, we shouldn&#39;t round their probability to zero. Experiencing such a moment once or twice in your life might make up for dozens of other fizzled attempts at bettering yourself.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Does it Happen? Why Does it Fail?</h2><p> My speculative theory of these kinds of personal transformations is:</p><ul><li> <strong>There&#39;s a temporary change in your optimism, confidence and valuing of effort.</strong> This kind of momentary effect can come from reading a self-help book, having a role model who inspires you to work at something, or having a private epiphany.</li><li> <strong>The environment creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.</strong> The easiest way to see this kind of positive feedback loop would be setting a goal, achieving it, and suddenly biasing your other estimates of self-efficacy or confidence upward.</li><li> <strong>Once the initial feedback loop wears off, you&#39;re already in a sufficiently “different” position for your life.</strong> Your habits and material circumstances of personal identity have shifted to a new equilibrium position, and you now maintain it.</li></ul><p> Under this theory, most self-improvement efforts fizzle because the momentary burst of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, and the equilibrium you reach is <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/03/25/permanent-habits/">metastable</a> . Eventually you decay back to the person you were before because a lot of gravity is pulling you back that way.</p><p> Even when this kind of transformative change occurs, I think there are probably limits on how far it can go. People&#39;s <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/10/20/change-yourself/">beliefs about their malleability</a> vary wildly around the actual figure. Some people suddenly become incredibly optimistic about their ability to become popular, successful, smart, enlightened, etc., as well as the converse, where people adopt a fixed view of themselves and believe change is impossible.</p><p> The transformations I&#39;ve witnessed in other people tend to involve modestly unrealistic beliefs. This raises an interesting question of whether some amount of self-delusion helps in crossing over into a new equilibrium, even if it&#39;s unsustainable. Were that true, though much-maligned by skeptics, this small break from reality may actually be key—a truly sober assessment of one&#39;s possibilities may not encourage enough of a transitory change in your beliefs to shift over to a new equilibrium.</p><p> At the same time, it also seems clear that most changes are not of this magnitude. Discovering that you can take charge of your life is probably something you can only really do once or twice in your life. Once that&#39;s firmly established in your beliefs, further adjustments are probably minor in comparison—tweaks to your habits, skills or perspective.</p><p> Since the world is flush with people pitching and persuading others to adopt a self-actualization belief set (even if it is partly delusional), a related question is why such transformations are relatively rare. My suspicion is that they&#39;re harder to sustain because while it&#39;s easy to find sources of inspiration, it&#39;s much harder to locate the positive feedback loops that keep the motivation going.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Can You Trigger a Change in Yourself?</h2><p> Given that many of us would like to have a sudden, positive shift in the direction of our lives, is there anything we can do to facilitate this kind of transition? </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beyond_blog.png" alt=""/></figure></div><p>我不知道。 While I&#39;ve witnessed it many times, the change itself happens as a by-product of something else rather than the person actively seeking it out.</p><p> However, I do think there are a few generic ingredients that may increase the likelihood of such a change:</p><ul><li> <strong>Success with self-set ambitions.</strong> Self-efficacy seems to be a crucial motivational component here. It&#39;s not enough to know that building a business, learning a language or getting in shape is possible. You have to believe <em>you</em> could do it. While achieving one thing doesn&#39;t necessarily translate to across-the-board motivation, having more success is likely to encourage increased self-efficacy.</li><li> <strong>Reading a lot of books with inspiring-but-credible messages.</strong> If modest self-delusion plays a role in initiating these transitions, the temporary boost you get from reading motivational material may increase your chances of hitting an inflection point. But inspiration fails if you don&#39;t believe it. Hence, finding optimistic sources that seem credible to you is more important than just picking the cheesiest self-help title.</li><li> <strong>Finding challenging, worthwhile goals.</strong> At least in my own case, I felt like the desire to start a business was a catalyst. The combination of an attractive goal and knowing I wouldn&#39;t succeed unless I worked really hard seemed vital.</li><li> <strong>More randomness.</strong> A final catalyst is having experiences that take you outside your comfort zone. The idea here is that greater variability in your day-to-day experience increases the likelihood of stumbling upon a positive feedback loop that alters your course in life.</li></ul><p> In the end, I&#39;m not entirely sure why some people become obsessed with personal productivity, mindfulness meditation, exercising daily, building a business or becoming a straight-A student. I don&#39;t know why the direction of their life seems to pivot abruptly after a particular experience. But I agree with the reader who emailed me that even if such transitions are rare, they seem important and poorly understood.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/">Some Thoughts on Becoming Self-Actualized</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/16/becoming-self-actualized/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Thu, 11 May 2023 04:41:23 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15111 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> My pick for the best ten books on learning how to learn better!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/05/10/10-best-learning-books/">Ten Great Books on How to Learn Better</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> What are the best books to read to become a better learner?

Today, I&#39;m rounding up some of those suggestions and trying to synthesize the advice for when (and when not) to use these tools for learning.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs</h2><p> Using applications like ChatGPT requires some care.</p><p> Part of the difficulty is that ChatGPT&#39;s human-like conversation abilities can be deceptive. Feeling like you&#39;re talking to a real person encourages you to rely on conversational expectations that may not hold with a machine.</p><p> For instance, we generally expect that most people do not make up facts. Large language models, however, routinely violate this expectation by providing fluent answers that may be totally wrong. The metacognitive ability to know what you don&#39;t know is underdeveloped in these applications.</p><p> Another expectation we have is that verbal fluency tracks other aspects of intelligence. We expect that someone who can spout lines from Shakespeare, explain quantum computing, and give a proof of the prime number theorem in rhyming verse would also be able to count. Thus, naively treating LLMs like a really smart and knowledgeable person is likely to backfire.</p><p> Those caveats aside, ChatGPT is clearly helpful for a range of tasks. Simon Willison suggests thinking of LLMs as a “ <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/">calculator for words</a> ”—something that can do useful things with text—rather than as a general-purpose intelligence or smart person.</p><p> I tend to agree. The more we can distinguish the cases where LLMs work well from where they don&#39;t (yet), the more we&#39;ll be able to take advantage of the new capabilities without falling into unexpected traps.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Ten Useful Learning Strategies with ChatGPT</h2><p> After receiving dozens of emails from my audience on how they have been personally using ChatGPT to learn, I&#39;ve compiled some tips with some of the most common suggestions.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Create your own Socratic tutor.</h3><p> By far, the most common use readers reported was using an LLM as a personal tutor.</p><p> Asking ChatGPT to explain tricky concepts, unfamiliar code or problems seems like an area where LLMs might do alright. And the only reasonable substitute (a human expert) is notoriously expensive and in short supply.</p><p> If you do this in conjunction with a class or textbook, the risks of mistakes also seem attenuated since you still have a primary source to compare against. Challenge explanations that don&#39;t jive with what you&#39;ve read in the book rather than taking everything the AI says at face value.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Practice chatting in new languages.</h3><p> The next most common way people used LLMs to learn better was as a language tutor. This seems like a task LLMs are well-equipped for. Whatever their other flaws, they can produce grammatically correct text.</p><p> Many people set up their conversations with ChatGPT so that the AI could go back and forth between the language they are learning and English explanations when they got confused. Likely, those explanations may be imperfect, but human tutors also often give incorrect accounts of the grammar and vocabulary they manage to use proficiently.</p><p> Another use is rewriting texts to be at a more beginner-friendly level of reading comprehension. Graded readers and comprehensive input are great strategies for learning to read in another language. Unfortunately, learner materials are often sparse or uninteresting. You can use an LLM to transform a text you want to read that is written at a fluent native level into something appropriate for your current ability.</p><p> Duolingo seems to be getting in on the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">LLM game as well</a> . I&#39;ve been harsh on the drag-and-drop style of language learning used in earlier versions, but these new advances may force me to revise my opinion.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Generate summaries of longer texts.</h3><p> Summaries are another area where LLMs seem to excel. Consumer applications already exist for <a href="https://consensus.app/">generating summaries</a> of journal articles or research topics.</p><p> Several readers said they were using these AI tools to provide digests of their substantial reading material, helping them keep atop new developments in their field.</p><p> Good summaries, especially those fine-tuned to your particular needs, might be a good way of navigating the large information loads we often face in knowledge work. You could use it to help prioritize which documents to read in-depth or do a first pass organizing unfamiliar material. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="488" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15095" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1024x488.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-768x366.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary-1536x732.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Summary.jpg 1619w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> It looks like ChatGPT is not able to open links to summarize directly, but it often does a reasonable job hallucinating with famous texts like the one I used above. Until this functionality is standard in the consumer application, it&#39;s better to copy+paste.</p></blockquote><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 4. Dialog with long documents.</h3><p> LLMs also can help you “ask questions” of longer texts. For instance, when reading a scientific paper you could quickly query the sample size or ask for the methodology or results. <a href="https://consensus.app/">Consensus</a> does this while offering references, so the risk of mistakes seems reduced when you can easily double-check the LLM&#39;s work.</p><p> While there are more fanciful usages here, such as people asking ChatGPT to impersonate a given writer and dialog with them, I suspect the ability to ask natural-language questions of documents and receive replies with references is a useful tool for dealing with large texts.</p><p> That said, you must be prepared to fact-check the LLM&#39;s answers. For instance, in the dialog captured below, I asked ChatGPT to list evidence supporting strongly-guided instruction, and it cited a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.59.1.14">review article by Mayer</a> . But it falsely claimed Mayer&#39;s work was a meta-analysis, which it isn&#39;t. In fact, the paper isn&#39;t even a comprehensive literature review but simply looks at three prominent cases of the failure of discovery learning. If taken at face value, this response can potentially mislead, but it&#39;s relatively easy to “check” the AI&#39;s work if you know what text it is transforming. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="745" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15096" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-768x559.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog-1536x1118.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT-text-dialog.jpg 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 5. Rewrite texts at different levels of explanatory depth.</h3><p> A major difficulty in following expert thinking is that most expert-level text is written for other experts. Concepts are unexplained, context is lacking and jargon abounds. This means that most people must rely on translators, such as general-market nonfiction or science writers, who present what experts think in a more readable format.</p><p> There seem to be two approaches to using AI tools here. One is simply asking an LLM to explain a popular concept in simpler terms, such as: “Explain quantum computing like I&#39;m an eighth-grader.” The other is to provide ChatGPT with a text or explanation and ask the AI to rewrite it in a more digestible manner.</p><p> I tend to think the latter is a little more reliable since you have the source material to compare with rather than taking ChatGPT&#39;s word for it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. Clear up unfamiliar jargon.</h3><p> Several years ago, I remember reading Tyler Cowen&#39;s <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution blog</a> and being perplexed by his frequent, unexplained use of the term “Straussian” to describe ideas or other thinkers. I Googled for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.</p><p> After a lot of research, I understood the term as meaning, roughly, “closely reading between the lines in prominent thinkers&#39; ideas, looking for what they really meant but couldn&#39;t always express because of prevailing censorship and intellectual orthodoxy.”</p><p> Had ChatGPT existed during my confusion, I could have just gotten this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="422" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15097" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1024x422.png 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-300x124.png 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-768x316.png 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1536x632.png 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div><p> Many readers found similar benefits in using LLMs to figure out jargon and terms used within a particular community in a way that dictionary definitions often fail to elucidate.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. Create study plans and agendas.</h3><p> This usage surprised me, but it showed up enough times among reader replies that I include it here. People seem to like using AI to tell them how and when to learn.</p><p> For instance, some readers asked ChatGPT to break down a complex learning goal and give them a curriculum. Others preferred to go even further, asking for ChatGPT to create a studying schedule for them, given their constraints for the day.</p><p> I probably wouldn&#39;t trust LLMs to give me a well-designed curriculum for a subject. But if I was learning something completely new, it might be a decent starting point. Sometimes the hardest part of approaching a new field is breaking down what appears to be an insurmountable goal. Similarly, sometimes being told when to study can help overcome the inertia of getting started.</p><p> While skill breakdowns might be alright, ChatGPT still struggles with creating reading lists, confabulating books and references. Thus, while it might do well for decomposing an ambiguous learning task, I wouldn&#39;t trust it to give me good resources (yet).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. Provide refreshers on forgotten or infrequently used tools.</h3><p> Programmers were the biggest professional group to reply to my query. I can&#39;t say whether this is because programming is uniquely well-suited to LLMs or because programmers, as a group, are more likely to adopt novel software tools.</p><p> The productivity advantages for programmers seem obvious. I don&#39;t write much code these days, so I haven&#39;t made much use of this well-publicized feature of LLMs. But since a lot of coding is relatively routine, the ability to have a machine create the first draft for an algorithm clearly saves a lot of time.</p><p> While there are cases of people with zero programming knowledge relying on AI output to build applications, I suspect these might be tricky to debug and maintain. In contrast, an expert programmer can override ChatGPT&#39;s output for a language he or she knows particularly well.</p><p> The place LLMs seem to work really well is at the fringes of a programmer&#39;s expertise. Many programmers told me that they found AI helpful in getting starting hints in unfamiliar languages or tools. Their base of programming experience allowed them to make sense of and implement the output, but their unfamiliarity with the underlying language meant the AI saved them a lot of time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. Generate flashcards based on text. (Tentative)</h3><p> Flashcards are a powerful learning tool. They&#39;re also a pain in the butt to make.</p><p> Some readers said they were using ChatGPT to generate flashcards for subjects they&#39;re studying. This seems well within the LLM abilities as a “calculator for words.” Thus, with the correct prompts, you could get fairly good results here—provided you&#39;re inputting the material you wish to see transformed into flashcards and not expecting the LLM to get the facts on its own (see below).</p><p> However, given the difficulty of making “good” flashcards, I wouldn&#39;t enter any into my Anki without reviewing them first. Nonetheless, making flashcards is tedious, so getting a first draft that I later review might speed up the process considerably. The risks seem relatively limited if you confirm the cards&#39; correctness before putting them in your deck.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. Use it to organize your notes. (Advanced)</h3><p> As someone who does a lot of research, I often waste a lot of time trying to locate my notes. Robert Martin finds the same problem. Searching via keywords is fraught because sometimes you can&#39;t remember the exact term you used, even if the meaning is roughly the same.</p><p> Martin <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2023/02/05/gpt-for-second-brain/">solves this problem</a> by using the embedding feature of LLMs. While not strictly ChatGPT, this tool from the same family of natural language processing techniques allows you to find semantically-related notes rather than exact keyword matches.</p><p> Personalized LLMs that live on your hard drive and access your existing data may be a valuable application. I&#39;d love to be able to search things I know I&#39;ve seen but can&#39;t quite recall where.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Some Things NOT To Do</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Don&#39;t expect AI to get facts right.</h3><p> LLMs frequently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">make stuff up</a> . These hallucinations are problematic if you depend on ChatGPT to give correct answers. The prevalence of these mistakes is difficult to say right now. When Wikipedia was released, for instance, “experts” were in an uproar about how the user-generated nature of the website meant it couldn&#39;t ever be relied upon as a source. Except Wikipedia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438900a">actually does fairly well</a> , and some of these knee-jerk reactions were misplaced.</p><p> LLMs haven&#39;t reached Wikipedia&#39;s quality in terms of facts, and we still don&#39;t know much about when they&#39;re likely to get an answer right and when they&#39;re likely to make stuff up. For now, it seems best to use them for situations where the cost of an incorrect answer is minimal, either because you can look it up in a verified source, or because your use of the AI for isn&#39;t factual in nature.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 2. Don&#39;t expect AI to get citations right.</h3><p> While LLMs sometimes mess up facts, they seem abysmal at getting citations right. They frequently invent authors, papers, studies and research.</p><p> I wouldn&#39;t use a LLM for any research that I needed to cite, and I would always double-check the sources it does provide.</p><p> Similarly, I wouldn&#39;t ask an LLM to give me a reading list or references to specific books or authors (unless, possibly, the authors were quite famous and likely to be well-represented in the data set).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 3. Don&#39;t expect AI to get the math right.</h3><p> I believe it&#39;s a mistake to attribute general intelligence to LLMs based on their ability to do many tasks at a human level or beyond. As with chess bots and image classifiers, the technology behind LLMs is extremely narrow compared to what we would expect of a human who scored similarly on verbal tests.</p><p> One finding from psychology is that much of reasoning is performed by different subsystems in the brain than those devoted to language. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">This paper</a> argues that LLMs seem to match the neurological evidence from double-dissociation studies: you can have fluent verbal abilities with seriously impaired reasoning and vice versa.</p><p> As such, LLMs are really bad at math. And not just higher-level math that humans struggle with. LLMs often fail at <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/large-language-models-like-chatgpt">basic counting tasks</a> . Thus I suspect LLMs would be uniquely bad at a task like providing practice problems for a math class and grading the answers. ChatGPT might be able to explain a math concept well, but be unreliable at actually using it.</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Have you used ChatGPT or other AI tools to further your learning?

However, before I share that post, I&#39;d like to address a different question.</p><p> One question a few readers have is whether ChatGPT will eliminate the need to learn things. After all, if you can easily ask the machine a question and it will spit out an expert-like answer, what&#39;s the point of getting students to write essays, memorize facts or try to remember a lot of knowledge?</p><p> Like everyone, I&#39;m gobsmacked by the performance of large language models like ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. That said, it&#39;s hard to predict things, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/">especially about the future</a> . And I suspect the evolution of new AI tools is harder to predict than most things. We have poor intuitions about what sorts of problems machines can solve, and so the general discourse around AI as a field tends to swing between wild pessimism and optimism as we learn more about the path ahead.</p><p> One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won&#39;t make learning obsolete.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Why Learning Still Matters</h2><div class="inline-podcast"> <small>Listen to this article</small> <br /><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="20" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1521622480&#038;color=%23219895&#038;inverse=false&#038;auto_play=false&#038;show_user=true"></iframe></div><p> One reason I can feel confident about the continued value of learning is that while ChatGPT is novel, the kind of technological change it has brought about is not.</p><p> Humans have been inventing technology that has replaced aspects of cognitive work for thousands of years. In every case, the result of that substitution was not a diminishing of the need for skills and knowledge—but an increase.</p><p> Consider the impact of writing. Human knowledge used to be transmitted orally. When writing became available, thinkers such as Socrates decried the damage it would do to people&#39;s memory. We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down.</p><p> Or consider calculators, which have been widespread for decades. You probably have one on your smartphone. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p><p> A robust finding in educational psychology is the importance of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Why-Knowledge-Matters-Rescuing-Educational/dp/1612509525/ref=asc_df_1612509525/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=296035595995&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17947244405290068344&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001551&amp;hvtargid=pla-464465047333&amp;psc=1">background knowledge</a> . People who know more about a subject can understand and retain more of what they read. Knowledge outside your head doesn&#39;t count, since it can&#39;t participate in learning and reasoning.</p><p> Similarly, even if you use a calculator all the time, you understand math better when you first learn to do it by hand. Working through low-level calculations creates conceptual and procedural skills that build an intuitive sense for the underlying algorithms. While you can save effort by using a calculator, the intuition you gained from your initial learning helps you recognize if the calculation is correct and how to fix things when they go wrong.</p><p> The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Will ChatGPT Change What Knowledge Matters?</h2><p> So perhaps we can safely reject the extreme position that learning will become obsolete. Won&#39;t LLMs change what <em>kind</em> of knowledge is worth learning?</p><p> This is probably the case. But it&#39;s not obvious to me what the transition will be, and I don&#39;t think most people&#39;s intuitions on this are correct either.</p><p> The gut reaction seems to be that since large language models can easily spit out an explanation to any question answerable within the sphere of well-documented human knowledge, LLMs devalue this kind of book learning.</p><p> Even putting aside the hallucinations and failings of current LLMs and assuming engineers perfect the technology to the point where it rarely gets these questions wrong, I&#39;m not sure this intuition is correct.</p><p> As mentioned in the research on background knowledge, your ability to ask a useful question and then understand an LLM&#39;s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess. For instance, economist and polymath Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/what-is-the-single-best-way-of-improving-your-gpt-prompts.html">argues</a> that asking an economics question to ChatGPT goes better if you ask it to answer in the style of Milton Friedman or Paul Krugman. Your own economics knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.</p><p> This isn&#39;t a new phenomenon. If the answers to all the world&#39;s questions were already on the Internet, but you didn&#39;t know where to look, they&#39;d be invisible to you.</p><p> Contrary to the supposition that book learning will be less relevant, I suspect that it will be <em>more</em> important. The people who get the most programming help from ChatGPT are existing programmers—since their knowledge allows them to ask well-formulated programming questions and accurately assess the results. LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> What Subjects/Skills are Still Worth Learning?</h2><p> A few people wrote to me wondering whether it even makes sense to learn second languages, programming, creative writing or art, given the ever-increasing powers of these applications.</p><p> My feeling is that, on the whole, the value of these skills hasn&#39;t changed much. What will probably change is the differential value of mastery versus novice levels of various skills. There may be fewer professional opportunities available for mediocre programmers, writers, artists or translators. This kind of skill polarization has been going on for a long time, as I documented in my book <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">Ultralearning</a> . ChatGPT is just a continuation of current trends.</p><p> But just as there&#39;s a diminished value for someone who can crank out stock art or kludge together a website, there&#39;s probably increased value for those sophisticated enough to use these tools in collaboration with their professional expertise.</p><p> What if we get genuinely general artificial intelligence? An application so advanced it can perform any cognitive task better than a person, or indeed, better than a person in collaboration with a machine? Chess seems to provide an illustrative example, with top chess engines picking better moves than top players—even those who have access to top chess engines.</p><p> In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we&#39;ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we&#39;ll all get <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem">turned into paperclips</a> .谁知道？</p><p> But, despite the uncertain long-term forecast, I&#39;m fairly confident that the short-to-medium-term impact of tools like ChatGPT will not be to devalue learning complex skills and knowledge, but will actually increase the value of these activities. As with other technological advances that have come before, it will be the quick and enthusiastic learners who reap the benefits.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/">No, ChatGPT Doesn&#39;t Mean You Don&#39;t Need to Learn Things</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/25/chatgpt-learning-obsolete/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:26:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15058 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> A summary of my views on how transfer of learning works, based on research.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Transfer occurs when learning one thing helps you learn or do something else. It&#39;s arguably the most important issue in educational psychology. After all, we spend years in the classroom. One would hope the things we learn make us more productive on the job, conscientious as citizens or intelligent in our daily lives.</p><p> Yet it turns out the titular question is really difficult to answer. This is because the answer depends on three different questions, each of which is itself incredibly complicated:</p><ol><li> How do we perform skills?</li><li> How do we acquire them?</li><li> What sorts of skills are used in real life?</li></ol><p> About two years ago, I started a research project to learn everything I could about transfer. It quickly became clear that understanding transfer depended on answering the other three questions, so my research broadened drastically.</p><p> Despite two years of research and a lot of writing about transfer (including a chapter of <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/">my book</a> ), I still don&#39;t have a definitive answer for how much transfer we can expect. But I&#39;d like to share at least how I&#39;ve come to think about the issue.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question One: How Do We Perform Skills?</h2><p> Essentially, transfer is a product of overlap. We should expect transfer from one skill to another when something in those two skills is essentially the same. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15068" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Nearly every well-articulated theory of transfer is an overlap theory. What differs between theories is the “something” which potentially overlaps. Let&#39;s consider some candidates:</p><ul><li> <strong>Broad mental faculties.</strong> In <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/formal-discipline">this framework</a> , “reasoning” or “memory” overlap across different skills. This theory likens the mind to a muscle that can be strengthened through many types of practice. This would suggest transfer is quite broad and that almost any strenuous mental activity should produce benefits.</li><li> <strong>Stimulus-response.</strong> Perhaps, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorists</a> , the mind is merely a collection of habits, stimulus leading inevitably to response? This view would suggest transfer is extraordinarily limited—every superficial change in a situation would require a new skill.</li><li> <strong>Propositions and productions.</strong> Theories like <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/02/15/act-r/">ACT-R</a> argue that our brains store skills in essentially two forms: small chunks of factual knowledge and simple component procedures. Complex skills and knowledge are simply aggregates of these foundational pieces.</li><li> <strong>Schemas.</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)">Schema-based theories</a> claim that knowledge is organized in patterns larger than individual actions or chunks. These patterns roughly correspond to “templates” with both fixed and variable components. For instance, we might have a “birthday party” schema that includes birthday cake and presents, but only optionally clowns or pointy paper hats.</li><li><strong>神经网络。</strong> The brain is made out of neurons, and we have some idea of how those neurons process information. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">Connectionist</a> theories take these basic neuronal properties as a starting point and posit theories of learning based on them. Teasing out implications for transfer is harder here, but it would most likely look like an overlap in the synaptic connectivity between two skills.</li><li> <strong>Activity systems.</strong> Perhaps transfer isn&#39;t in our heads but is a property of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">broader social and physical environments</a> ? In this view, the person relies on their environment to perform a skill, and transfer fails when those environmental supports are altered.</li></ul><p> Only the first two seem to be demonstrably false. The <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/09/13/brain-training-doesnt-work/">mind is not like a muscle</a> , nor is it a simplistic stimulus-response device.</p><p> I find the information-processing perspective of cognitive science to be the most persuasive. The mind is essentially computational (although quite different from computers made out of transistors). Answering the question of transfer depends on how the algorithms for skills are composed.</p><p> From this perspective, what seems safe to say is that skills can only reliably influence each other if they overlap in either their procedures or knowledge. If two skills don&#39;t use the same process, and the knowledge they depend on is different, there shouldn&#39;t be much (if any) transfer.<span id='easy-footnote-1-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-15058' title="I’m leaving aside analogies. Analogies suggest two domains that have nothing to do with each other may actually be a source of transfer. But another way of saying this is that analogies suggest an abstract commonality between two superficially different domains. When analogies are useful, they tend to share an overlapping deep structure, so I would include them as an &amp;#8220;overlap&amp;#8221; theory, even if the overlap is an active process rather than the nature of the mental representations themselves."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Two: How Do We Acquire Skills?</h2><p> How the mind represents skills is only one part of understanding transfer. There&#39;s also the issue of how we acquire these representations. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15069" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> Here, a few things seem pertinent:</p><ul><li> <strong>Expert-novice differences.</strong> Experts appear to represent ideas at a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220480253_Categorization_and_Representation_of_Physics_Problems_by_Experts_and_Novices">deeper level than novices</a> . The most likely explanation is that skills become more abstract as we encounter more examples and learn to generalize and distinguish concepts.</li><li> <strong>Automaticity effects</strong> . Skills tend to recede from conscious awareness with experience. There are many different proposed mechanisms for this in psychology, but a consequence seems to be that how the expert <em>thinks</em> they perform a skill may not fully capture what they&#39;re actually doing.<span id='easy-footnote-2-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-15058' title="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Read-Thinking-Learning-about/dp/0262510766/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1678392728&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;>;science on reading&lt;/a>; seems relevant here: careful experimentation seems to indicate that fluent readers decode words letter-by-letter, even though we may feel like we recognize meaning holistically as we look at text."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li> <strong>Mnemonic effects.</strong> Another complication is that even if there is no overlap between two skills in expert performance, there might be an overlap at an earlier stage of acquisition. Vimla Patel has explored this in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10401338909539394?journalCode=htlm20">medical cognition</a> . She comments on the finding that basic science tends to be used infrequently in clinical practice. However, that doesn&#39;t mean learning basic science is useless for doctors because it forms a scaffolding for making sense of clinical knowledge, thus aiding in its acquisition.</li><li> <strong>Declarative-to-procedural transitions.</strong> Another characteristic progression in learning is for skills to start as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_knowledge">declarative knowledge</a> —things we know and think about explicitly—and shift to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge">procedural knowledge</a> —actions we take automatically. This transformation implies that skills may have different patterns of transfer at different levels of mastery as their dominant mental representation changes.</li><li> <strong>Cognitive load.</strong> Different training activities work better for <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/01/04/cognitive-load-theory/">different stages of skill acquisition and working memory capacity</a> . Studying an example, for instance, is better than solving a problem when cognitive load is high, but the opposite is true when cognitive load is low. Efficiency of practice, then, is more than just a question of overlap but also of the stage of learning. Early on, drills, practice on component skills and structured lessons are more helpful. Later on, complex, realistic practice matters more.</li></ul><p> On top of these psychological details, there&#39;s the issue of pedagogy. There are often multiple methods for teaching something. Those methods have varying levels of generality and can apply to a broader or narrower range of concepts. Transfer, then, also depends on how something is taught.</p><p> My sense from reading this research is that there are a few pitfalls to avoid:</p><ul><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer potential by the abilities of novices.</strong> Novices have a more superficial, context-bound understanding. That&#39;s more indicative of their phase of skill acquisition than the ultimate potential for transfer.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t judge transfer on one-shot problem-solving tests.</strong> Problems often require many pieces of knowledge and procedures to solve correctly. Failure in the tested task could mean a complete failure of transfer, or it could mean that a person is 99% of the way there but still missing one piece. A better test is to train a person on task A, then on task B, and measure the time savings on B from the knowledge and skills acquired in A.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t trust experts&#39; perceptions of how they do a task.</strong> Experts are<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Ourselves-Discovering-Adaptive-Unconscious/dp/0674013824">bad at introspecting</a> their cognitive procedures. We tend to underrate knowledge we&#39;ve already acquired, seeing it as obvious. The ease of automaticity fools us into thinking the complex skills we perform are simple. This can lead to an inappropriate devaluing of “basic” skills.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Question Three: How are Skills Used in Real Life?</h2><p> The final question is about the kinds of cognitive activities people engage in during work, school and daily life. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15070" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills3.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> While possibly the most relevant question of the three, it is also the hardest to answer. Few studies have looked systematically at the kinds of cognitive skills people regularly employ at work and at home.</p><p> Critics allege that much of what we learn in school has little real-world application.</p><p> John Anderson <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Memory-Integrated-John-Anderson/dp/0471249254">reports</a> that employers either want very basic skills (which the educational system should already be teaching) or highly specific skills that no universal curriculum could aspire to. Similarly, Peter Cappelli <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Good-People-Cant-Jobs/dp/B00FJUFFD8/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Smadj&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_p=22f5776b-4878-4918-9222-7bb79ff649f4&amp;pf_rd_r=138-5005353-2745032&amp;pd_rd_wg=vgzAZ&amp;pd_rd_r=36883576-42ee-403e-89ee-0ccca61e0046&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk">argues</a> that surveys show employers tend not to highly value academic skills.</p><p> Jean Lave <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cognition-Practice-Mathematics-Culture-Everyday/dp/0521357349/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2UHF1GP7YERE1&amp;keywords=jean+lave+cognition+in+practice&amp;qid=1681499209&amp;sprefix=jean+lave+cognition+in+practic%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-2">found</a> that the mathematics taught in school is rarely what people use in their daily routines.</p><p> Bryan Caplan <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652">argues</a> that much of education is signaling—showing others we have smarts, conformity and work-ethic—rather than cultivating those abilities. From this perspective, the real purpose of schools is to sort people, not to teach useful skills. School knowledge doesn&#39;t apply to real life, Caplan argues, because that&#39;s not the function it serves in society.</p><p> Supporters of education argue that just because most skills aren&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re useless. We may become specialists of one sort or another, but unless we assign everyone a career at birth, we want to maintain maximum flexibility until our adult years. A side-effect of this desire to maintain flexibility is that we end up learning a lot that we don&#39;t ever end up using, or that is insufficiently concrete to apply in practice without further training.</p><p> Similarly, education proponents <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Mindware-Tools-for-Smart-Thinking/dp/B0719GQ4GZ/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=284313338521&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9001556&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=15299944356742459999&amp;hvtargid=kwd-314760458336&amp;hydadcr=14950_9480932&amp;keywords=mindware+nisbett&amp;qid=1681499263&amp;sr=8-1">point out</a> that just because a skill isn&#39;t used doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be. Statistics is a powerful tool for reasoning about many important issues. The fact that people are statistically naive shows we should be teaching them more, not declaring it impotent!</p><p> Whether we apply a skill in a new context depends on the effort it requires. Practice can lower the effort of applying a skill in real life and create more situations where it is convenient to use. Imagine rewinding time to before widespread literacy; it would be perverse to argue that reading isn&#39;t useful because most people don&#39;t read.</p><p> My perspective is that, while many academic subjects aren&#39;t used, it&#39;s difficult to appreciate a subject until you learn it. Given that we generally cannot “infer” a domain of knowledge simply by encountering problems that apply it, this argument favors accumulating more knowledge than you think you&#39;ll need.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Side Note: Transfer of Effort, Motivation and “Noncognitive” Skills</h2><p> Thus far I&#39;ve been looking at transfer through a cognitive lens. A somewhat separate issue is the transfer of things like the ability to focus and study for long periods of time, the ability to resist temptations, or the motivation to want to learn.</p><p> Many of the same arguments used above apply to noncognitive skills as well. There&#39;s unlikely to be something like a general faculty you can improve with bulk training efforts for motivation, persistence or focus.</p><p> That said, the arguments about transfer here are somewhat different because these are not complex skills (in the information processing sense of “complex”). Sitting at your desk and focusing for eight hours may be difficult, but it&#39;s not <em>computationally</em> demanding.</p><p> Thus while I think it&#39;s ridiculous to imagine improving your memory by memorizing Latin verbs, it&#39;s not ridiculous to imagine improving your ability to focus by regularly sitting down to focus. Believing that cognitive skills are highly specific, and should show limited transfer, is not logically incompatible with a more general transfer of effort or persistence. </p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15071" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-Much-Transfer-Between-Skills4.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><p> I might write a fuller summary of my views later, but I want to clarify that while “speaking French” and “being able to focus” are both discussed as skills, they have a different locus of difficulty. French is hard because there are lots of words, grammar and mental processes you need to perform it. Focusing is hard because the naive reward center of your brain wants to go on Twitter instead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Summarizing My Thoughts on Transfer</h2><p> If you take one thing from this article, it should be that transfer is complicated.</p><p> As a practical takeaway, I would agree with roughly the following:</p><ul><li> Transfer should be minimal between unrelated skills.</li><li> Transfer between related subjects depends on how much they overlap in content and procedures, with the caveat that those content and procedures may extend beyond what is traditionally thought of as the curriculum.<span id='easy-footnote-3-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-15058' title="For instance, I tend to think learning Chinese will help with later learning Spanish, even though there is virtually no overlap in the vocabulary or syntax. Instead, what is transferred is a more abstract understanding of languages and how they are learned."><sup>3</sup></a></span></li><li> Academic subjects can transfer to real life, but this transfer can fail because:<ul><li> We are missing components of the skill for applying it. This can include “recognizing” when an academically learned skill applies (for instance, applying algebra to a real-life quantitative problem).</li><li> We haven&#39;t automated the skill enough to pass the cost-benefit threshold.</li><li> We can&#39;t actually perform the skill with only our academic ability.</li><li> Many academic skills are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_knowledge">inert</a> , but they&#39;re still potentially helpful for accelerating learning that builds upon them.</li></ul></li><li> All else being equal, practice on more cognitively similar tasks should maximize overlap and, thus, future transfer. However, there are important exceptions to this because of cognitive load, retrieval effects and overall difficulty. Therefore identifying the most beneficial practice activity may be more complicated than simply matching it with the activity you&#39;re trying to get good at.<span id='easy-footnote-4-15058' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span> <span class='easy-footnote'><a href='https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-15058' title="This is a major misconception I had when I wrote my “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/&quot;>;do the real thing&lt;/a>;” piece."><sup>4</sup></a></span></li></ul><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/">How Much Transfer Should We Expect Between Skills?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/18/skill-transfer-explained/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Tue, 11 Apr 2023 23:50:55 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15030 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Ten interesting papers on the science of learning and thinking.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/">Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I&#39;ve shared <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/05/03/more-recent-reading/">some</a> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/03/28/creativity-mastery-learning/">reading</a> <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/11/7-books-learning/">lists</a> based on my research for my upcoming book.

Students are often bored and disengaged in lectures. They fail to transfer what they learn to the real world. Real life involves active effort and problem-solving, whereas so much of traditional schooling seems to be regurgitation of memorized facts.</p><p> The authors here argue that those intuitions are misguided. The research favors strongly-guided forms of instruction. Methods in which skills are carefully explained and taught consistently outperform methods that rely on students discovering, inventing or creating their own solutions.</p><p> This paper attracted enough controversy that <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Constructivist-Instruction-Success-Sigmund-Tobias/dp/0415994241/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=duffy+tobias+constructivist+education+success+or+failure&amp;qid=1634325516&amp;sr=8-1">an entire book</a> was created with various experts weighing in on both sides.

A Taxonomy for Far Transfer</a> by Susan Barnett and Stephen Ceci</h2><p> Transfer is undoubtedly the most important issue in education. We&#39;re engaging in transfer whenever we learn something in one setting and apply it in another. Thus, the utility of any school, book, course or training experience hinges on transfer.</p><p> Despite this, many more studies report failures of transfer than robust successes, and the causes of this have been endlessly debated.</p><p> Barnett and Ceci review some of the research while adding that what we call “transfer” can really be broken down into several different dimensions, such as:</p><ul><li> Transfer between domains (eg, learning about exponential growth in a biology class and applying it to the stock market)</li><li> Transfer between contexts (eg, learning to multiply in school and then applying that at the grocery store)</li><li> Transfer over time (eg, learning something in 9th grade and applying it during your working life)</li></ul><p> My opinion is that resolving questions about transfer is so difficult because they&#39;re actually questions about how the mind works. Knowing how much transfer is possible hinges directly on how the mind represents skills and knowledge.

If our self-efficacy is low, we may think that success is valuable but still fail to find the motivation to take action. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15054" srcset="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sociallearningtheory.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <sup>Reproduced from Social Learning Theory by Albert Bandura</sup></figcaption></figure></div><p> Bandura posited four contributors to self-efficacy, two weak and two strong:</p><ol><li> <strong>Bodily arousal (weak)</strong> .

Bloom&#39;s challenge was to see if any pedagogical techniques could approach the gains seen with tutoring but could apply to a classroom with dozens of students.</p><p> Bloom believed he had found an answer in mastery learning. In this approach, students are given many interim tests. Those who fail to master the material are given new explanations, practice and an opportunity to try again. The idea is that catching difficulties early will prevent them from becoming ongoing problems.</p><p> While most meta-analyses of mastery learning put the effect size closer to <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Visible-Learning/dp/B07SR5D29D/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3DM52P3XHBU14&amp;keywords=visible+learning&amp;qid=1680383890&amp;sprefix=visible+learnin%2Caps%2C178&amp;sr=8-3">0.5 standard deviations</a> , a far cry from the two sigma Bloom sought, this is still a relatively strong effect.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 6. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0040373">Blind Variation and Selective Retentions in Creative Thought as in Other Knowledge Processes</a> by Donald Campbell</h2><p> Drawing on an analogy to biological evolution, Campbell argues that randomness is an overlooked variable in learning and creative thinking.</p><p> He argues that all knowledge generation proceeds by:</p><ol><li> <strong>A trial-and-error process to induce some knowledge about the world.</strong> As with evolution, we try things out and retain what works.</li><li> <strong>Using previously-acquired knowledge instead of guessing.</strong> Once you uncover valid knowledge using the first process, you can apply it without the need for random guessing.</li><li> <strong>Even applying previously-acquired knowledge, there is variation and randomness generating further possibilities.</strong></li></ol><p> This suggests that much of what we associate with inventive creativity is simply (a) acquiring the relevant set of knowledge associated with the field and then (b) trying out lots of things and keeping what works.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 7. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00461528209529247">Antagonism Between Achievement and Enjoyment in ATI Studies</a> by Richard Clark</h2><p> Aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI) are when the same learning technique elicits different effects in students with different prior abilities.</p><p> A common finding in ATI studies is that low-ability students learn much better with highly-structured approaches, whereas higher-ability students benefit from less-structured environments. One explanation seems to be that if you lack the necessary knowledge and skills, guidance ensures you learn the material correctly. Still, if you already have them, then challenging, open-ended environments give you needed practice applying what you know.</p><p> It would seem reasonable to expect students to opt for the method of learning that works best for them. Low-ability students would recognize their difficulties and seek structure; high-ability students would try more challenging assignments.</p><p> Except when Clark reviewed the ATI literature, he found the opposite. Students tend to prefer the method that works less well for them, often unaware that it hinders their achievement. One explanation is that learning is effortful, and we enjoy learning methods that seem to save us effort.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 8. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.102.2.211">Long-Term Working Memory</a> by Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch</h2><p> Few concepts are as central to the science of learning as working memory. Our mental bandwidth is limited, and we can only keep in mind a few things at a time.</p><p> Given that we can only hold a few things in memory at once, how do we perform complex tasks?</p><p> One theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> . Through experience, we learn to recognize whole patterns of information as a single unit, allowing us to keep more in our heads at once. Remembering a random seven-digit number is hard, but we easily recall our phone number.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch review evidence that suggests chunking is insufficient to explain expert performance. For example, experts seem strangely impervious to interruptions. When reading a story rife with distractor sentences, comprehension of the story itself remains largely intact. This starkly contrasts with typical memory experiments, where distractors can completely wipe out memory for a task.</p><p> Ericsson and Kintsch argue that as we gain skill in an activity, we get better at using our long-term memories as a form of working memory, effectively expanding our capacity for familiar tasks.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 9. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fcdev.12272">Does Learning to Read Improve Intelligence</a> by Stuart Ritchie, Timothy Bates and Robert Plomin</h2><p> Keith Stanovich was among the first to propose that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022057409189001-204?journalCode=jexa">reading ability could bootstrap intelligence</a> . The logic of the hypothesis is compelling:</p><ol><li> Much of the world&#39;s knowledge is available only through reading.</li><li> Reading ability tends to be self-reinforcing, as good readers get more practice than poor ones.</li><li> By reading more, people can learn more things and thus become smarter.</li></ol><p> The study by Ritchie et al. explores this hypothesis further by examining how early reading ability impacts later intelligence. They studied identical twins to control for genetic differences in intelligence. The researchers found that twins with higher reading ability showed greater improvements in intelligence over time compared to their sibling.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"> 10. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0364021394900167">Eliciting Self-Explanations Improves Understanding</a> by Michelene Chi, Nicholas de Leeuw, Mei-Hung Chiu, and Christian LaVancher</h2><p> I&#39;ve long been a fan of what I call the Feynman Technique: take a complicated concept or procedure, and explain it as if you were teaching it to someone else.</p><p> Thus, it was interesting to come across formal research on self-explanations! In this experiment, the researchers encouraged students to explain what they were learning. They found that engaging in explanation tended to increase students&#39; understanding of the material.</p><p> My preferred explanation for this effect is attention. When reading an explanation, you generally don&#39;t have much motivation to test whether or not you understand it. In contrast, when generating an explanation, you get clear feedback about what you know and what you don&#39;t. This feedback returns your attention to the source material or problem to work out what is missing, resulting in a richer understanding than if you had stuck to the reading alone.</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/">Ten of My Favorite Papers on the Science of Learning and Thinking</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/11/favorite-papers-science-of-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reader Request: How Should I Use ChatGPT to Learn Better?</title><link/> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/<comments> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/#respond</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Young]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Mon, 03 Apr 2023 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/?p=15023 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> Have you been using ChatGPT in your learning efforts?

It has the ability to write code, <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/capabilities-of-gpt-4-on-medical-challenge-problems.html">pass the US Medical Licensing Exam</a> , translate in dozens of languages, summarize text and even write <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-chatgpt-wrote-poem-about-bing-beating-google-2023-2">funny limericks</a> . It also sometimes <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/">makes stuff up</a> . Incredibly, it does all this largely through being trained to predict the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">next word of text</a> .</p><p> Much of the discussion surrounding ChatGPT has reflected the hope and anxieties about how it might change society. Will it end an era of stagnant technological productivity growth? Will office jobs become obsolete? Will the robots <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA1sNLL6yg4">kill us all</a> ?</p><p> I&#39;m hardly qualified to write on most of these topics. But given that much of this blog is centered around the art of learning, I&#39;m curious how tools like ChatGPT might change how people acquire new skills and subjects. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/rote-memorize-cards_blog.png" alt="" width="450" height="450"/></figure></div><p> Since I know about as much as anyone else about this (ie, not much), instead of pontificating, I thought I&#39;d ask for people to share innovative ways they&#39;ve been using (or seen someone use) ChatGPT to learn new topics (not just cheat on their homework).</p><p> Feel free to share your ChatGPT studying tips, and perhaps in a future essay I can post some links to the approaches that look most promising!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/">Reader Request: How Should I Use ChatGPT to Learn Better?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog">Scott H Young</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/04/03/chatgpt-studying-tips/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
